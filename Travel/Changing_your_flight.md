## Homework:
Write a dialog asking to change your flight.

Agent: Hi there, how can I help you?

Me: Hello, I need to change a flight I scheduled last week.

A: Do you have your confirmation number?

M: Yes, it’s 41BD8574.

A: Okay, let me repeat that 41BD8574?

M: Yes, that’s it.

Agent: I located your booking. You’re scheduled to depart from San Francisco
International at 2:20 PM and arrive at Vancouver International Airport at 4:55
PM. What do we need to change?

M: I’ve just learned that my business meeting in Vancouver will start earlier. I
need to arrive there that morning.

A: I see, there is an early morning flight that departs from San Francisco at
8:20 AM, that can get you to Vancouver by 9:55 AM. Is that earlier enough?

M: No, I’m afraid not. I need to arrive in downtown Vancouver by 9:00 AM.

A: I see, there is a red-eye flight available the night before. You could leave at
11:20PM and arrive by 12:55 AM.

M: Okay, I think that might be best. I can have a rest at the hotel before my
meetings.

A: Oh good. Now there is a fee to change the flight.

M: No problem, how much is the fee?

A: It will be 100 dollars. Would you like me to charge the credit card you used
to book the flight?

M: Yes, please do. That’s my company credit card.

A: Okay, so your new confirmation number is 52NW7888.

M: Great thank you.

A: Thank you for flying with us.
