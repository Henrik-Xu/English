## Homework
Write a dialog discussing a foreign food you want to try.

Friend: What’s your favourite kind of foreign food?

Me: Oh, that’s hard. I like a lot of foreign food. I guess I really like Pho.

F: Pho? Where’s that from?

M: It’s from Vietnam. It’s a beef noodle soup. Simple but delicious.

F: Oh, that sounds very good.

M: What’s your favourite?

F: I love Kimchi.

M: What’s that?

F: Kimchi is pickled, spicy, cabbage from South Korea.

M: Oh, so it’s a side dish? How do you eat it?

F: It can be a side dish. But it’s often included in the dish too.

M: How spicy is it? I dunno if I could eat that. My taste buds can’t handle spicy
food.

F: It’s not that spicy. It’s a very pleasant kind of spicy.

M: Hmm, still might be too spicy for me.

F: If you don’t like spicy food, then how do you try local food while traveling?
So much exotic food is spicy.

M: Well I ask them to make it not spicy or… I just don’t eat it.

F: Oh no! You’re missing out on so much great food.

M: Yeah, I guess I should try to get used to spicy food the next time I travel.
You know, when in Rome…

F: Exactly. Do as the Romans do.
