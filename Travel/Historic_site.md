## Homework
Write a dialog discussing an interesting historical site.

Friend: If you could see any historical site in the world, where would you want
to go?

Me: I’d like to see Machu Picchu. That place really captures my imagination.
F: Why’s that?

M: It’s very mysterious. They built the whole village so high up on the
mountain, but nobody knows why they left. Historians say they just suddenly
left one day, but they don’t know why.

F: Oh wow, that is mysterious.

M: Yes, very. Where would you like to go?

F: To be honest, I’d like to see Auschwitz and the Holocaust Memorial.

M: Oh, wow. I’d like to see Auschwitz too, But I think it’d be too emotional for
me. Your family is Jewish right?

F: Yes, we are. That’s why it’s an important place for me to visit. I have to
remember my ancestors.

M: That’s beautiful. Do you think it will be an emotional trip?

F: Yes, definitely.

M: So, are there any other happier places that you’d like to see?

F: Yes! I’d also like to see the Angkor Wat temples in Cambodia.

M: Oh, I’ve heard of that temple. It’s also very mysterious.

F: Yeah, to be honest I don’t know much about the history of it. But if I go there
I can learn all about it!

M: Yeah, that would be the best way to learn!
