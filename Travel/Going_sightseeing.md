## Homework
Write a dialog asking for advice about sightseeing.

Me: Hey, you’ve been to Rome, right?

Friend: Yes, I went last year.

Me: Great, what did you go see when you were there? I’m going next month
and I want to make a list of all the must-see attractions.

Friend: Well I saw the Colosseum of course, Vatican City, Trevi Fountain, The
Pantheon, The Roman Forum… And even more.

Me: Okay, what was your favourite?

Friend: Probably the Colosseum. I love the ancient architecture and the
Colosseum is the most impressive ancient Roman structure.

Me: Oh wow, was it really crowded there?

Friend: It is, but I went early in the morning. At like 8:00. The crowds weren’t
bad then. But by the time I left at 11:00 it was packed with tourists. So make
sure to go there early.

Me: Oh good advice, thank you.

Friend: No problem. And the same goes for the Vatican City. Go there as early
as possible. It’s so beautiful there, but very touristy.

Me: Okay, how about the Roman Forum? I heard you can see where they
actually stabbed Julius Caesar??

Friend: Yeah, I guess you can. There isn’t a marker for where that happened
though, so you’ll have to look it up ahead of time. The Roman Forum was really
cool though. But it’s so hot in the Italian sun. Make sure you bring lots of water
and maybe a sun umbrella.

Me: Yeah, I’m going in the summer, so I’ll definitely have to watch out for that.

Friend: Oh yeah big time.

Me: Any other advice for me?

Friend: Yeah, watch out for pickpocketers in the tourist areas and don’t talk to
strangers. There are many scam artists who hang out near the tourist
attractions.

Me: Oh wow, thanks for the advice!
