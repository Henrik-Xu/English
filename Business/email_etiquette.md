## How to Write a Business Email

Here are three guidelines for writing business e-mails.

1. Use formal language. Avoid slang, casual expressions, and abbreviations. `slang` 俚语
2. Make sure the e-mail address you type is correct and avoid sending the same generic e-mail to

multiple people. Your business email must consist of a variation of your name and surname.

3. When sending business emails, you should follow the following structure:
* Subject line: header, title
* Salutation: greeting
* Body
* Closing
* Signature

`Salutation` `salut`: hello in French and when meet or goodbye. `aloha`: hello and goodbye.

称呼;称谓;称呼语;问候语;对收信人的称呼 [ˌsæljuˈteɪʃn] formal noun

A salutation is a greeting. 

Your email should have an appropriate salutation. 

`Subject line`

This is a short phrase that summarizes the reason for your message or the goal of your communication. It

is important to include a subject line when sending a professional email so your audience knows exactly 

what to expect and can locate the message easily if needed. For example:

"Notes from marketing strategy meeting"

"Follow up: performance review"

`Follow up`

跟进;跟踪;追踪;随访;后续跟进 [ˈfɑːloʊ ʌp] phrasal verb

After an initial meeting, interview etc. you should talk or meet with the person again. This is 

called a follow up. 

You should send them a follow up email. 

I’m just following up after our meeting last week. 

`initial`: first adj  first letter of your name, noun. acronym is for things. 缩写

`Salutation`

The salutation is the greeting at the beginning of your email. A salutation is important because it 

personalizes the email. For example:

"Good morning, Mr. Smith,"

"Hi Rebecca,"

Use the recipient's title for professional emails, and for casual business emails, you can use just their first 

name.

`Recipient`

收件人;受方;接受者 [rɪˈsɪpiənt] noun

The recipient is the receiver of something. 

Make sure to greet the recipient. 

`Body` 

defination: the meat and potatoes - the main course, the most important or basic parts of something.

The body of the email should include your full message. The body can several paragraphs or a couple of 

lines depending on your message and request. Keep in mind that shorter emails are typically better in a 

busy workplace. Make your message clear, to the point and easy to read. For example:
```
"Thank you again for the meeting on Monday. I have attached the notes from our marketing strategy 
meeting for you to review at your leisure. Please note, there are action items listed on the document."
"I'm reaching out to follow up with you about your performance review. If you log in to the system, you will 
be able to see the updated document. If you have any questions or concerns, please be sure to send 
them by end of day on Friday."
```

`“Like peas and carrots`

means any two things that go well together, get along very well together, or are well-suited.`

`Leisure`

闲暇;空闲;休闲 [ˈliːʒər] noun

Leisure is time that is spent doing what you enjoy when you are not working or studying .

“At your leisure” means when you have time to do something without hurrying. 

Please review this at your leisure.

`Closing`

This is the last line of your email before your signature that should summarize the message. Reiterate 

any requests you've made in the body of your message. For example:
```
"I look forward to hearing your thoughts. Thank you!"
"Thank you again for your time."
```

`Reiterate`

重申;反复重申;频频重申;重申,反复地做 [riˈɪtəreɪt] verb

Reiterate is a formal word that means to repeat something.

At the end of the email you can reiterate any important information.

`Signature`

The signature is where you identify yourself by name, title and any other information relevant to your 

communications. Most email programs allow you to set a fixed signature that's automatically added to the 

end of every email you send. For example:
```
"Regards,
Mary Smith
Director of Finance, Dwight Inc.
467-464-6366"
```

`autograph`: Everyone has a signature, while only famous people have autographs.

`Innovative`

引进新思想的;采用新方法的;革新的;创新的 [ˈɪnəveɪtɪv] adj.

Innovative means something that introduces new ideas or new ways of doing things.

The design is very innovative. 

`Candidate`

(竞选或求职的)候选人，申请人;投考者;应试者 [ˈkændɪdət] noun

A candidate is a person who is trying to be elected for a political position or is applying for a

job.

You seem like a great candidate for this position. 

`applicant` : 申请人 `runner-up` - second place
