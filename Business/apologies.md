## How to Make a Business Apology
`Unique`

独特的 [juˈniːk] adj. unicorn 独角兽，unicycle 独轮车 unilateral 单方面

Every situation is unique, so every apology should also be unique.

`Circumstance `

If a customer has been injured by your product, you should offer compensation. 

1. Correct timing. 

It is best to apologize as soon as you realize that there has been a 

mistake. However, it is equally important not to rush and to take enough time to prepare what 

you want to say.

2. Means of communication.
 
There are many ways to apologize: you can apologize in person, 

over the phone, in an e-mail or a handwritten letter. Eye contact makes the apology more 

personal; however, if a person was deeply hurt, an email might be a better option. Every 

situation is unique, so take your time to choose how to deliver your apology in a way that 

best suits the given circumstances.

3. Explanation without excuses. 

After apologizing you can shortly explain why it happened

but be careful not to start making excuses. Keep in mind that the customer is always right 

and take full responsibility for the mistake.

4. Clear structure. Whether written or spoken, an apology needs to have a clear structure:
* apologize
* clearly state what you did wrong.
* acknowledge the inconvenience caused.
* promise that it won't happen again.
* offer compensation (if it is necessary or appropriate to do so)
