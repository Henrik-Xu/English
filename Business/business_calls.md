## How to Make a Business Phone Call

* Introduce yourself. 

  Start the conversation by introducing yourself - state your name and the name of 

your company. After that, state the purpose of your call.

* Be polite, brief and informative. 
  
  Make sure to use polite expressions (e.g. I'm afraid I can't hear you.) 

and indirect questions when making requests. (e.g. I would like to...)

* Repeat the important information. 
  
  If you are deciding on some specific details such as the date and 

place of a meeting, make sure to repeat it twice so there are no misunderstandings.

* Leave a message. 
  
  If the recipient is busy, you can leave an informative message. Don’t forget to mention 

your contact details before ending the call if you are calling for the first time.

* End the call in a pleasant manner. 
  
  Thank the person for their time and wish them a good day.
