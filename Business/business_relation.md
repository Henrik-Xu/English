# Business Relationships

`Trust`

相信；信任；信赖[trʌst] noun. Verb 

Trust is the belief that somebody is good, sincere, honest and will not try to harm or trick you.

How do you form trust?

`Assume` - `assumption`

假定；假设；认为 [əˈsuːm] verb [əˈsʌmpʃn] noun

To assume something is to think or accept that something is true without any proof.

To assume something is to make an assumption.

`Reputation`

名誉;名声[ˌrepjuˈteɪʃn] noun 

Reputation is the opinion that people have about what somebody is like, based on what has happened in the past.

In business, having a good reputation is important.

`Competence` opposite is incompetence

能力;胜任 [ˈkɑːmpɪtəns] noun competent adj.

Competence is the ability to do something well.

He has a reputation for being highly competent. I recommend working with him.

`Bond`

纽带；联系；关系；契合 [bɑːnd] noun

A bond is something that forms a connection between people or groups, such as a feeling of friendship or 

shared ideas and experiences.

It’s important to build up a trust bond with a new business partner.

## North American & European (Western) Cultures

* Managers from Western cultures expressed that they generally just assume a 
  
potential new business partner is going to be trustworthy.

* At a cultural level, people automatically trust others until they prove themselves 
 
otherwise.

* Despite this, managers would also test these assumptions through trying to verify 

information.

* One way in which managers would verify is to ask lots of questions and assess 
  
the openness with which they are handled, or not.

* Managers in Western cultures do not place much focus on social relationships to 

ensure trust — people separate work from personal life very easily.

## East Asian Cultures

* East Asian managers overall described a three-stage process to determine 

trustworthiness.

* First, they seek information about a potential business partner’s reputation 
  
through their network, whether that be personal or professional. A good 

reputation is key.

* Second, they meet the potential partner and test their competencies. This is done 
  
through subtle questioning.

* Third, they engage in social and relationship-building activities to further cement 

whether a bond of trust exists.

## What is your trust default?

`Benevolent`

慈善的；仁慈的；乐善好施的 [bəˈnevələnt] adj.

Benevolent is being kind, helpful and generous.

I trust that he will be a benevolent boss. 

`Exploit` `Exploited` `Exploiting`

利用(…为自己谋利);剥削;压榨;运用;利用;发挥 [ɪkˈsplɔɪtɪd] verb 贬义词

If you say that someone is exploiting you, you think that they are treating you unfairly by 

using your work or ideas and giving you very little in return.

I recommend that you don’t work for this company, they have a reputation for exploiting their 

employees.

`Benefit of the doubt`

怀疑的好处 [ˈbenɪfɪt əv ðə daʊt]

Giving someone the benefit of the doubt means that you assume they have good intentions. 

I want to give them the benefit of the doubt. 

`Proven`

被证明的;已证实的 [ˈpruːvn , ˈproʊvn]

If something is proven it is tested and shown to be true.

He has proven himself to be a good worker. 

```
Trust is usually defined as a positive expectation that the other party will 
act in honest and benevolent ways, reducing fear that one may be exploited. 
Considering both parts of this can help us distinguish the trust defaults in the 
West versus China.
Generally speaking, in the West the default is “trust.” I’ll give you the 
benefit of the doubt, and consider you basically trustworthy until you do 
something that breaks our trust. In China, the default tilts more toward 
“distrust” – I only award you my trust after you’ve proven yourself worthy of it. 
As one Chinese business executive told me: In China you build trust first, 
once that is achieved, only then you do business. In the West, on the other 
hand, people are used to doing business almost immediately when they work in 
the same industry. Westerners feel more comfortable conducting business and 
building trust at the same time if the opportunity arises.
```

**What is your trust default? Do you think strangers are trustworthy or untrustworthy?** d

`trustworthy`

towards yourself tursting - towards others.

`Personal Space Expectations` `Personal space`

个人空间(站立或坐着时与他人保持的距离范围) [ˌpɜːrsənl ˈspeɪs]

Personal space is the space directly around where you are standing or sitting.

Personal space can differ depending on the culture. 

Europeans tend to get very close in each other’s personal space. 

`Arms-length`

保持距离型 [ɑːrmz leŋθ]

Arms-length refers to the length of your arm.

To keep someone at arms-length physically, means to keep them one arms distance away.

To keep someone at arms-length emotionally, means that you won’t let that person into your 

personal life. 

```
Cultural differences in business include varying expectations about 
personal space and physical contact. Many Europeans and South Americans 
customarily kiss a business associate on both cheeks in greeting instead of 
shaking hands. While Americans are most comfortable at arms-length from 
business associates, other cultures have no problem standing shoulder-to-shoulder 
with their peers or placing themselves 12 or fewer inches away from 
the person to whom they are speaking.
It's not unusual for female colleagues in Russia to walk arm in arm, for 
example, while the same behavior in other cultures may signify a more 
personal or romantic relationship.
```

Has someone ever given you a kiss on the cheek as a greeting? If so, how did you react?

I wasn't use to it.

`High and Low Context`

Context

(事情发生的)背景，环境，来龙去脉;上下文;语境 [ˈkɑːntekst] noun 

Context is the situation in which something happens and that helps you to understand it.

Context is also the words that come just before and after a word, phrase or statement and 

help you to understand its meaning.

Some languages are more contextual than others. 

```
For example, English is a low-context language. Meaning that it’s easier to understand what 
people are talking about even if you don’t know the context. 
Chinese is a high-context language, meaning it’s very difficult to understand what people are 
talking about if you don’t know the context. 
Different cultures communicate through various levels of context. Low context cultures such as Canada, 
the United States, Australia, New Zealand 
and most of Europe, require little or no explanation of orders and requests, 
preferring to make decisions quickly. High-context cultures, which include most 
other Eastern and South American populations, require and expect much more 
explanation about orders and directions. Businesses that operate with a low context form of communication 
spell out the specifics in the message, while 
those from a high-context communication culture expect and supply more 
background with their messages.
```

**Do you prefer precise and descriptive instructions? Or simpler instructions?** 

`precise` 精确的

TL;DR too long, didn't read.

## Differing Meanings of Cues

`Social cues`

社会暗示;社会线索;社交提示 [ˈsoʊʃl kjuːz] noun 

A social cue is something subtle that can clue you in to how the person is feeling. 

A social cue could be raising the eyebrows, rubbing hands together, or turning your back 

slightly to the speaker. 

`Ironclad`

铁甲 very strong, unbreakable

Literally, ironclad means to coat something in iron, like an ironclad ship.

Figuratively, ironclad means firm or secure as to be unbreakable. 

An ironclad agreement is an unbreakable agreement. 

`Figuratively`: 比喻地

`Saving face`

保全面子 [ˈseɪvɪŋ feɪs]

To save face is to save yourself from embarrassment.

```
The idea of saving face is deeply rooted in Asian culture.
Western and Eastern cues have substantially different meanings in 
business. The word "yes," for example, usually means agreement in Western 
cultures. In Eastern and high-context cultures however, the word "yes," often 
means that the party understands the message, not necessarily that he agrees 
with it. A handshake in some cultures is as ironclad as an American contract. A 
period of silence during negotiations with an Eastern business associate may 
signify displeasure with your proposal. While frank openness may be desirable 
in Western cultures, Eastern cultures often place more value on saving face 
and avoiding disrespectful responses.
```

Let's shake on this?

**Have you ever misunderstood a social cue from someone of another culture?**

## The Importance of Relationships

`Familial ties`

家庭关系 [fəˈmɪliəl taɪz] noun 

Are you more likely to trust someone with familial ties?

```
While Western cultures proclaim to value relationship-based marketing 
and business practices, in high-context cultures a relationship involves 
longtime family ties or direct referrals from close friends. Judgments made in 
business often are made based on familial ties, class and status in 
relationship-oriented cultures, while rule-oriented cultures believe that 
everyone in business deserves an equal opportunity to make their case. 
Judgments are made on universal qualities of fairness, honesty and getting the 
best deal, rather than on formal introductions and background checks.
```

`proclaim`: declare,announce

`referrals`: 转介

**Are you more likely to trust someone who has been recommended by a family member or friend?** 

pull yourself up by the bootstraps: 自力更生

`bootstraps`: 引导程序

`disapprove it more`: 更不赞同

`pull the string to get a job`: To use personal connections to obtain a position

`jealousy`: 妒忌 envy
