5. Practice your conversation.
6. Remain confident.
7. Stay flexible.
8. Know when to say 'no'.

### Determine your value
It's important to approximate the value you can bring to the company. Knowing your value can 

help you define a salary that best compensates you.When determining your value, consider the

following:

`License`

许可证[ˈlaɪsns] noun

A legal document giving official permission to do something.

Do you have your driver’s license ?

Teaching license.Medical license.Gun license.Liquor license.Cosmetology license.

* Your education
* Your related experience
* Your overall experience
* Your skills
* Your licenses and certifications
* Your location
* Your leadership abilities

### Research the market
Take some time to see what other professionals make in the same or similar positions can help 

you determine how much you can ask for. Look for the average salary of the job title nationally 

and locally, and if possible, check to see what companies in the same industry usually offer. 

You should also consider factors that can influence the average, like experience, licenses, and 

higher education.

### List your expenses
`Offset`

抵消；弥补；补偿 [ˈɔːfset] verb

To use one cost, payment, or situation in order to cancel or reduce the effect of another.

I want to negotiate a higher salary to offset the cost of the long commute.

`Factor in`

将…计入;将…考虑进去 [ˈfæktər ɪn] phrasal verb

If you factor a particular cost or element into a calculation you are making, or if

you factor it in, you include it.

Remember to factor in staffing costs when you are planning the project.

`Retirement plan`

退休计划 [rɪˈtaɪərmənt plæn] noun

In the US, retirement plans are commonly called 401K. 

In Canada, retirement plans are called RRSP Registered Retirement Savings Plan. 

What are retirement plans called in China? 

Do companies help their employees prepare retirement savings?

`Childcare`

儿童保育;儿童护理;育儿 [ˈtʃaɪldker] noun

Childcare includes babysitters, daycare, or a nanny. 

North American grandparents often help with childcare, but not to the extent of Chinese 

grandparents. 

Make sure any additional expenses you may need to make are offset by a higher salary. For 

example, if you'll need to move to a new city for the job, you need to factor in moving expenses. 

Here are some other expenses you should consider:
* Longer commutes
* Loss of other benefits, like retirement plans or flexible hours
* Additional childcare hours

### Prepare an outline
`Acquiesce your request`

默许你的请求 [ˌækwiˈes] 

Formal. To accept a request without arguing, even if you do not really agree with it.

Have an outline of your talking points ready, especially if you're going to negotiate in person. 

Start with a statement of gratitude, such as thanking the hiring manager for the opportunity. 

Then, explain that you feel you deserve a higher salary and some key reasons why. Be specific 

as possible so the employer is more likely to acquiesce to your request. Detail related 

achievements, experience and skills, and use numbers where possible to put your qualifications 

into perspective.

### Practice your conversation
`Body language`

肢体语言;身体语言;体态语 [ˈbɑːdi ˈlæŋɡwɪdʒ] noun

The process of communicating what you are feeling or thinking by the way you place and 

move your body rather than by words.

It’s important to be aware of your body language during interviews.

If you're going to negotiate your salary in an in-person meeting or over the phone, it's helpful to 

rehearse the conversation so you know exactly what to say. Ask a trusted friend or colleague to 

help you practice and give you feedback. If they're comfortable with the idea, they can act as 

your manager and ask questions that could come up during the meeting. You can also practice 

in front of a mirror, which can help with your body language.

### Remain confident
`Qualifications`

镇定;沉著;冷静;沉着;镇静 [kəmˈpoʊʒər] noun

Qualifications include certifications, licences, university degrees, and experience. 

What kind of qualifications do you have for this job?

It's important to stay confident throughout your negotiation. Exhibiting confidence shows you 

believe in your qualifications and ability to contribute to the company. When you stay composed, 

the hiring manager will be more likely to consider you. You can stay confident by remembering 

that you performed the research necessary to find what you're worth in the current market. Keep 

your research available and reference it to show the employer that you're serious.

### Stay flexible
Though the salary is probably one of the most important factors for you, it's helpful to stay 

flexible throughout negotiations. A common tactic in salary negotiation is to ask for slightly more 

than what you expect. This gives you room to talk, and even if the employer offers less, you'll 

like get a salary that you're comfortable with.

It's also helpful to consider your future with the company. If there's plenty of room for you to 

grow and get a higher salary in the future, then it may be worth it to accept the job. Similarly, if 

you feel you can gain valuable experience in the role that you can apply elsewhere, consider 

accepting a lower salary initially, then negotiating for a raise later.

### Know when to say 'no'
`Hesitant`

犹豫;犹豫的;迟疑的;犹豫不决的;犹豫不决 [ˈhezɪtənt] noun

Slow to speak or act because you feel uncertain, embarrassed, or unwilling.

If the employer can't be flexible with the salary or other benefits, then it might be in your best 

interest to decline the offer. This is especially true if you're considering other offers or 

interviewing with more companies. Consider if the job can help you grow in your career, if it 

offers a better work-life balance or if the company has a good culture. If you feel hesitant 

accepting the offer, it's acceptable to decline it and continue interviewing.

`Sacrifice`

牺牲；舍弃 [ˈsækrɪfaɪs] verb

that seems more important.

Dear Margot,
Thank you for sending the package for the project manager position. I want to thank you again 
for giving me this great opportunity to work with such an incredible team.
Before I can accept the offer, I want to ask about the salary. When I interviewed with the 
department head, I had the chance to discuss how I could contribute to the team. I have an 
excellent track record of delivering projects both under time and budget. At my current position, I 
have saved clients over $100,000 without sacrificing quality. With my current experience and
certification, I believe my yearly salary should be $90,000 instead of $85,000.
I know I can bring a great deal of value to Hepburn Company and help you create the best 
products possible. Please let me know when we can discuss the salary further.
I look forward to hearing from you soon!
Thank you,
Oliver Perez

Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. As you know, I've been working with 
Sophisticated Solutions for nearly two years, and during my time here, I have made it a point to 
help my team however I can and learn as much as possible about my department. I believe I 
deserve a 10% raise for my efforts throughout this year specifically.
Over the past year, I stepped in as interim leader when my shift leader was on maternity leave. 
During that time, I worked additional hours to cover my regular duties in addition to the shift 
leader responsibilities. I was able to increase revenue during my shift by 5% over four months.
I'm also ready to accept additional responsibilities in order to receive a raise. With my current 
skill set, I believe I can take over the daily shift reports, and I'm more than capable of counting 
all of the cash drawers at the end of my shift.
I'm happy to answer any questions you may have or further discuss my qualifications. Please let 
me know what I can do to aid your decision.
```

### Here is another script you can use to practice asking for a raise:

```
"Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. In my current role, I'm excited to keep 
working toward key company goals and grow my personal responsibilities. As a result, I'd like to 
discuss my salary.
Based on the research I've done, which includes looking at averages for my job title in this 
metro area and considers my tenure here, my years of experience and skill set, I think a salary 
increase of 10% is appropriate.
In the time since my last salary adjustment, I've worked on several initiatives that have added 
significant value to the company. For instance, in the last few months, I have reduced customer 
complaints by 17% and reduced customer hold times by three minutes. These achievements 
have made me ready for a raise.
What are your thoughts?"
