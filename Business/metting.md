Good morning, everyone! Thank you for coming here today. Please, make yourselves 
comfortable. Since we are all here, we can start the meeting.
The purpose of today’s meeting is to generate new ideas for our product marketing, in order 
to ensure that we stay at the top of sales. Mark, I would like you to write the minutes of this 
meeting. Please, take a look at the graph of our sales since 2015. As you can see, until the 
autumn of 2019 our sales were gradually rising. However, from the autumn of 2019 they have 
been decreasing little by little. I truly believe in the quality of our products, therefore, instead 
of lowering our prices, I would suggest rethinking our marketing strategy.
Our research has shown that our brand is still very famous, but people do not pay much 
attention to our advertisements nowadays. We need to find a different approach to attract our 
potential customers. So let's discuss what can be done to improve the situation.
30 minutes later.
I think we've covered our main objectives for today. For the next meeting, I would like each 
of you to choose what you think is the best way to improve our marketing and make an 
analysis of it. Thank you all for your participation and see you next Thursday. Have a great 
day!

## Having a discussion

James and Alejandro are discussing how to improve Future Innovation's marketing strategy.

`Beg to differ`
恕难苟同;斗胆唱反调 [beɡ tu ˈdɪfər] phrase

You think old people hate technology? I beg to differ, all my grandparents use iPads. 

`IMO`: in my opinion, in my honest opinion, in my humble opinion.

```
Alejandro: So, James, what do you think? Any ideas on how we could improve our marketing?
James: Well... At first, I thought focusing on newspaper advertisements would be a good idea. 
But now I'm not so sure about that, to be honest... I guess that's not very popular these days.
Alejandro: Well, I beg to differ. I mean, I understand what you are saying, but, a lot of older 
people might be interested in some of our products, and they don't really use computers. So, 
perhaps, we could use newspaper advertisements for products aimed at the elderly.
James: Yes, that makes sense.
Alejandro: However, I think you also have a point: many young people don’t read newspapers.
James: Yes. I believe social media marketing might be the best way to reach younger 
generations. Also, I was thinking, we could perhaps make discounts for the first, let's say, fifty 
customers who buy our new product online.
Alejandro: That is a great idea! What about the number, how much of a discount do you think 
we should offer?
James: Maybe around 25%. What do you say?
Alejandro: Hmm, I'm not sure we can offer that much. Maybe 15 to 20% would be better. But 
we can discuss this later. Anyway, great idea, James!
