# Graphs
## Types of graphs:
Bar Graph, line graph, pie chart

Bar graphs show data with blocks of different lengths, whereas line graphs show a series of points 

connected by straight lines. This leads to a very different appearance, but the biggest difference is that 

bar graphs are more versatile while line graphs are better for showing trends over time or another 

measure with a logical progression of values (such as distance from a given point). Bar graphs can also

show frequency distributions (how often you observe different outcomes) much more effectively than line 

graphs.

Pie charts are those charts that look like pies, hence the name. Each pie is split into slices with each
 
slice representing one particular group of data. The size of the slice shows you how much of that group of

data you have. Businesses can use pie charts to show their market size, such as this one showing how 

much of the market a particular shoe company has.
