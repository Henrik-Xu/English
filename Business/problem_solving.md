## Dialogue Practice
Ms. Jackson, the director of Digital Photography, has called a meeting to discuss a problem that 
the company is facing.
Ellen Jackson: Hello, everyone. I called this meeting to discuss a problem that has recently 
emerged. After checking the statistics for our new branch offices, we have discovered that we 
have a sales coverage problem to deal with. Our options are quite limited, but we need to 
decide on a course of action. So, I'd like everyone’s attention. Our sales manager, Mr. Thomas, 
will explain the situation.
Manager So, as you all know, three months ago we opened two new branch offices, one in New 
York and another one in Chicago. However, it seems that we have made a mistake evaluating 
our potential clients. It turns out that our office in New York is not able to serve all of their 
customers. However, Chicago has more than enough resources to handle all of their customers. 
We need to do something about this. So, what are our options?
Alex I believe our best option would be to transfer some workers from Chicago to New York. 
That would solve the problems in both offices. An alternative would be to lay off some workers 
in Chicago, and start hiring more people in New York.
Manager We'd like to avoid layoffs if we can. So, I guess the only thing we can do at this point 
is ask workers to relocate. I'm just not sure that many would be willing to do so. A lot of them 
have families here...
Nina Then maybe we shouldn't target people with families unless they want to relocate. We 
could start by giving people the option to transfer to New York and see how that goes. On the 
upside, it is New York, after all, and many people dream about living there. Besides, the salary 
at the New York branch is higher. So, there might be a few volunteers.
Manager That might work. Any other ideas? How about we vote on this idea and if it gets a 
majority, we forward it to management? It will then be discussed thoroughly in tomorrow’s 
meeting.
The sales manager counts the votes.
Manager As we clearly see, the majority is for the proposal; therefore, I will forward it to 
management. Thank you all for engaging in this discussion.

Chairman Okay, guys. We are here today to come up with some ideas for a new toy that we 
could launch in spring.
Nina What kind of a toy do we want? Something high-tech or something simple?
Chairman I'm not sure yet, let’s just bounce ideas off each other and see where we get to.
Masa Well, if we are thinking of launching it in spring, perhaps our best option would be some 
kind of outdoor toy.
Chairman Yes, you are probably right.
James How about a helicopter? Drones are very popular these days, so I'm sure a toy drone for 
kids would be a huge hit.
Chairman I’m not too keen on that. We might not have the budget for it. Plus, many parents are 
not that eager to buy such an expensive toy for their children. We should probably stick to 
something more affordable.
Masa A toy boat, perhaps? We could make a simple, plastic toy boat with a really cool design.
Nina Wouldn't it be smarter to make a wooden sailboat? Eco-friendly toys are becoming 
increasingly popular, so I'm certain a wooden boat would sell better than a plastic one.
Masa Oh yeah, a wooden boat is classic. Maybe it could be a wooden boat building kit. A lot of 
children have been into making crafts during quarantine. 
Chairman That's not a bad idea. I think it could work. What do you all think?
James I really like the idea. I think we should go for it.
Chairman All right, then. I think we've reached a decision. Let's all start thinking about the
design and discuss it in our next meeting.
