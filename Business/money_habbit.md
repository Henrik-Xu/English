# Money Habbits

## Spending Money Habits

Taxes

税;税款 [ˈtæksɪz]

Tax is an amount of money that you have to pay to the government so that the government

can pay for public services.

The more money you earn in a year, the more taxes you pay.

`Income`

收入；收益；所得 [ˈɪnkʌm]

Income is the amount of money someone earns from work. 

Americans on average save about 5% of their income.

`Essentials`

必不可少的东西;必需品;要点;要素;实质 [ɛˈsɛntʃəlz]

Essentials include housing, food, and transportation. 

```
Americans on average made $78,635 before taxes and spent $61,224 in 2018. This means 
that American spending habits lead us to spend 78 percent of our incomes every 
year. Americans spend on things from essentials, like housing and transportation, to 
nonessentials, like entertainment.
America is known for a lot of things--football, apple pie, ridiculously large sports utility vehicles--
but saving extra cash in a savings account generally isn't near the top of the list.
```

`Hard-earned cash`

血汗钱 cash-dough Roll in the dough: means earn a lot of money.

Hard-earned cash is money made by working hard. 

How are you going to spend your hard-earned cash?

`Rainy day`

下雨天;不时之需;以备不时之需 [ˈreɪni deɪ]

A rainy day could simply mean a day that it is raining. It can also mean a day of need. 

I want to save it for a rainy day. - save for a time of need.

So what gives? Why do Americans tend to head to the mall instead of saving their hard-earned 

cash for a rainy day?

`Nurtured`

养育;培育;培养;后天;滋养 扶持；帮助；支持 [ˈnɜːrtʃər]

Here nurture means to help something grow and develop.

```
American culture nurtures the habit of spending money instead of saving money.
A lot of it has to do with culture and government, believe it or not. Unlike European countries
and other places that encouraged savings back in the day with things like postal savings banks, 
the U.S. government rarely nurtured saving habits.
```

`Frugal` - `frugality`

节约;节俭的;节俭;节省的;节俭的, 朴素的 [ˈfruːɡl]

To be frugal means that you don’t like to spend money and you only spend what is absolutely necessary. 

Americans are not frugal people. 

`virtue`: 美德

```
Save for a few moments in history when saving and frugality were stressed--during the World 
Wars, and some initiatives in the 1800s to establish small savings banks--a concerted effort to 
get Americans to save more hasn't been a major factor of our financial culture.
```

`concerted`: 努力的；共同筹划决定的；同心协力的

`In debt` – `indebted` – `overindebted`

负债 - 负债累累 in the hole, in the red-in the black.

To be in debt means you have a debt that you need to pay back. 

Overindebted means that you have a large debt that you need to pay back.

```
"The rest of the world tends to have very accessible savings institutions and the core European 
economies also very strictly regulate credit to protect people from becoming overindebted," 
Garon says, adding that in countries such as Germany and Italy, most borrowers have to pay off
their entire credit card balance each month. Meanwhile in North America you only have to pay a 
2 percent minimum of the balance on your credit card. 
```

`maxed out your credit card`: 信用卡上限

`Home equity line of credit`

房屋净值信用额度;房屋净值信用贷款;房屋净值信贷额度 [hoʊm ˈekwəti laɪn əv ˈkredɪt]

```
In a home equity line of credit you're borrowing against the available equity in your home and 
the house is used as collateral for the line of credit. As you repay your outstanding balance, the amount 
of available credit is replenished – much like a credit card.
Simplified: It’s a type of loan that uses your house as collateral.
```

`collateral`: 抵押品，担保品  `replenished`: refill 补充，重新装满

`Subprime mortgage lending` 

次级按揭贷款

A subprime loan is a loan offered at a rate above prime to individuals who do not qualify for primerate loans.

Simplified: It’s a type of loan with a high interest rate for people who do not qualify for a loan with a low

interest rate. 

Instead of promoting saving, over the years banks have made borrowing money increasingly 

cheap and easy, especially throughout the 1980s and 1990s when credit card borrowing, home 

equity lines of credit, and subprime mortgage lending exploded. The feast before the famine, as 

it were.

`The feast before the famine`: 饥饿前的盛宴

`Outstanding debt`

未偿债务 [aʊtˈstændɪŋ det]

The outstanding debt is the amount you have left to pay back.

Example. If you borrowed 100,000 dollars and have paid back 20,000 dollars. Your outstanding debt is 

now 80,000 dollars. 

```
Americans have more than a trillion dollars of outstanding debt to dig out from under. "That 
digging out process may go on for years and years," Garon says. "You've got a lot of people 
who are seriously in debt, and now they want to get out of debt so they're trying to pay it down, 
but for lower and middle-income households, it's very difficult to make much progress."
```

## Saving money habits

`Crucial`

至关重要的;关键性的 [ˈkruːʃl]

Something crucial is extremely important, because it will affect other things .

同义词 Synonyms: `Critical`, `essential`

Saving money is crucial to building wealth as you’ll see below. However, many of us do very

poorly with saving money. The statistics are really shocking. How does American saving money 

habits compare to others across the world? We’re getting completely crushed by individuals in 

other countries. 

`Financial cushion`

财政缓冲; 金融垫 [faɪˈnænʃl ˈkʊʃn]

A financial cushion is money that you have saved for emergencies. 

Most Americans have little or no financial cushion. 

```
America
Although America is deemed one of the richest countries, many of us have horrible habits for 
saving money. A shocking 28% of American families do not have any money saved up, no 
financial cushion and 60% don’t have enough money saved to cover emergencies. Of the 
individuals who do save money, they save only three percent of their income. Let’s put that into 
perspective. An American person who makes $45,000 per year is only saving less than $2,000 
if s/he’s saving anything at all.
England
What’s interesting, not surprising though, is we’re not alone in this. The British also share this 
horrendous habit. Amazingly, 70% of the British don’t have don’t have money saved for 
emergencies. Of those who do save money, they only save six percent of their income. This is 
not much better than us Americans. To put that into perspective, a Brit who makes the 
equivalent of $45,000 per year is only saving the equivalent of $2,700 of his/her income. Again, 
not much money saved at all.
```

`across the pond`: if you are in America, you say accross the pond, it means England and Europe.

`horrendous`: horrible.

`Beat by a landslide`

被山崩击败

They won by a landslide. We lost by a landslide.

To win by a landslide, means that you won by a huge lead. 

```
Asia
The individuals in Asia and South Asia have us beat by a landslide. In China, people generally 
save 50% of their income. Maintaining the same example from above, a person making the 
equivalent of $45,000 per year would save $22,500 in one year. Wow, that’s amazing. Well 
amazing to us but normal for them. In India, the majority of people save approximately 28% of 
their income. A person in India making the equivalent $45,000 per year would save $12,600 of 
that throughout the year.
```

`Buy something outright`

直接买东西

If you buy something outright it means that you have all the money to buy it upfront and you 

don’t owe anything after. 

Most Americans do not buy cars outright. They usually take out a loan to buy a car.

Most Americans don’t even buy cell phones outright. 

Do you prefer to buy something outright or pay for it month by month?

```
Why does this matter?
Why is the amount of money you’re saving important? There are several reasons why saving 
money is crucial to your financial well-being. Two key reasons are: acquiring items without 
borrowing money and building wealth. In order to acquire items or pay for things without going 
into debt you need money available after paying for needs such as shelter and food. Usually we 
don’t have enough money remaining at the end of the month in order to purchase items outright,
over 40% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Therefore, we have to save money in order 
to purchase things outside of bills.
```

`Retirement`

退休 [rɪˈtaɪərmənt]

Saving for retirement is crucial.

In Canada, we save for retirement with an RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan). 

In America, they save for retirement with a 401K.

Saving money and retirement

```
You should also be saving money for retirement and putting money aside in a retirement 
account. You will live at least 20 years after retirement (if you retire at age 65). What type of 
lifestyle do you want to have during those years? Do you want to have money to leave for the 
next generation? Would you like to travel to new countries, see the world?
If you would like to at minimum maintain your current lifestyle or live on a grander scale you 
need to have enough money saved to be able to live comfortably during retirement. You need to 
place enough money in a retirement account so that you can live off at least 8% of it per year. 
Hence, saving money is highly important to building wealth.
