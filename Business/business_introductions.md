Additional tips for an elevator pitch

After you've taken time to develop a pitch that's focused on your background and immediate 

goals, practice and refine it. Reading your elevator pitch out loud to yourself can reveal 

opportunities for better wording or extraneous information that might distract from your main 

points.

Here are a few tips on delivery as you practice:

* Take your time. An elevator pitch is a quick conversation by nature but remember to 

speak clearly and carefully. Keeping your pitch to around 75 words should help you 

deliver optimal information in a concise way.

* Make it conversational. It's helpful to plan your elevator pitch ahead of time and 

practice, but make sure it sounds natural. A good way to keep the pitch conversational is 

to memorize a general outline or key points of your speech. Keep this structure in the 

back of your mind, and adapt your pitch for each person you give it to.

* Use only conversational terms. Rather than using acronyms, technical terms or

industry-specific words and phrases, use language that everyone can easily understand. 

You will likely speak to people with a variety of career backgrounds, so try replacing 

technical terms with general, easy-to-understand language. Asking friends or family for 

feedback can be useful for this step.

* Express confidence. Some of the best elevator pitches work because they're delivered

with confidence. Stand up straight while you talk, and smile when meeting someone and 

delivering your pitch. Use a strong speaking voice to show confidence in your

experience and what you want in the future. If you're nervous, remember that the person 

you're talking to is likely interested in what you have to offer.

`Extraneous`

外来的;无关的;题外 [ɪkˈstreɪniəs] adj. 同义词 irrelevant

Extraneous is not directly connected with the particular situation you are in or the subject you 

are dealing with.

Don’t add any extraneous information. 

`Concise`

简洁性;言简意赅;简洁;精炼;简明 [kənˈsaɪs] adj.

Concise means to only give the information that is necessary and important, using few words.

Make sure you are clear and concise.

`colloquial`

Spoken English,conversational terms, not text book, technical terms.

`layman`: 外行人

`Acronyms`

缩略语 [ˈækrənɪmz] noun

An acronym is a word composed of the first letters of the words in a phrase, especially when this is 

used as a name.

If you don’t know the person you are talking to, it’s best to avoid acronyms because you don’t know if 

they will know them or not.

`Layman’s terms`

外行术语; 通俗语言 [ˈleɪmən] phrase 

Layman’s terms are plain and simple words for non-expert, average people to understand.
