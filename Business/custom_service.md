# Customer Service Skills

## What are customer service skills?

Customer service skills are the skills that you use when interacting with a customer. These 

skills can also be valuable when following up with a customer after an initial conversation. 

For instance, if you are a customer service representative for a cell phone provider, you'll 

need to be able to handle customer complaints, troubleshoot technical difficulties and assist 

with billing and payments. To accomplish this, you will likely use a variety of skills, including:

`representative`: 代表，short for rep

`Empathy` `empathetic` `compassionate`

同感；共鸣；同情 [ˈempəθi] noun

Empathy is the ability to share another person's feelings and emotions as if they were your

own.

Customers appreciate when you empathize with their situation.

`Sympathy`

同情;赞同;支持;意气相投;志同道合 [ˈsɪmpəθi] noun 

If you have sympathy for someone who is in a bad situation, you are sorry for them, and 

show this in the way you behave towards them.

Sympathy is just feeling sorry for someone, while empathy is showing the person that you 

understand their feelings. 

1. Communication. When interacting with customers, it's crucial that you be able to 

communicate with them in a clear, easy-to-understand way to help them solve a problem and 

answer their questions. You will also need to respond to requests in a timely manner.

2. Patience. Your customers may ask multiple questions, be upset or ask you to repeat yourself 

several times. It's important to be patient with customers, especially when they may be 

unhappy, to keep the conversation productive, remain friendly and ensure a positive 

customer experience.

3. Empathy. It's just as important to be patient with your customers as it is to be empathetic. 

For example, when dealing with a customer who is frustrated or angry, it's essential that you 

understand their feelings and experience and communicate with them accordingly. Practicing 

empathy can help you better understand the needs of your customers so that you can 

effectively assist them.

4. Technical knowledge. Having technical or industry knowledge can better prepare you to resolve a customer's issues.

## Customer-facing staff tips
1. Practice active listening
2. Learn to empathize with your customers
3. Use positive language
4. Improve your technical skills
5. Know your products and services
6. Look for common ground
7. Communicate clearly
8. Be solutions-focused
9. Admit mistakes

`common ground`: things you can agree about.

## Apologies

谦逊；谦虚 [hjuːˈmɪləti] noun

Humility is the quality of not thinking that you are better than other people; 

the quality of being humble.

Nobody is perfect. There will come a time where every single customer service representative has to 

apologize. Apologies are more valuable than credits or discounts. They’re an essential tool in your

team’s toolkits.

The Carey School of Business found that only 37% of upset customers were satisfied when offered a 

credit or financial compensation in response to an issue. If the business took the time to apologize on top 

of the credit, satisfaction increased to 74%.

Use these customer service scripts to recoup some trust and encourage humility amongst your customer 

service team members.

1. I hear you. I’m sorry that you’re still having trouble with this. I’m going to talk to my team to see 

what else we can do here.

2. I’m sorry that this hasn’t worked out as you expected. I’m going to work on getting this right for 

you as soon as possible. Give me just one second, and I’ll message again once I have 

something.

3. We’re very sorry, but the [deal the customer is looking for] isn’t taking place any longer.

4. I can see why you’d want that! I’m sorry, but it’s not something that we currently offer right now.

5. I’m sorry that the last recommendation didn’t work as expected. Can you try this one?

6. Ah! Sorry to hear about the trouble, but I have good news: here’s how you can fix it:

## The Dissatisfied Customer

`comply` means `go-along-with`, 遵守

`scenario` - scene,example 场景

`Platform`

计算机平台 [ˈplætfɔːrm] noun 

A platform in the digital world is the type of computer system or the software that is used. 

I post my videos to several platforms.

`Frame rate`

帧速率;帧频;画面更新率 [freɪm reɪt] noun

Frame rate is the frequency at which consecutive images called frames appear on a display.

The term applies equally to film and video cameras, computer graphics, and motion capture 

systems.

New video games have higher frame rates which make better video quality. 

Customer: Hi there, I bought this computer 3 days ago, but it doesn’t perform as well as described on the 

website. I chose my platform and the games I would be playing, but the computer doesn’t come anywhere 

close to hitting the frame rate that the manufacturer said it would even on the lowest graphic settings. I’d 

like to return it.

Representative: Hey there! No problem. You can return it or exchange it for a different computer. Many 

of our customers are serious gamers, and they speak highly of this (other) model. Why don’t you demo it 

and tell us what you think?

Customer: Wow! This computer’s great! I hope I won’t regret it if I do an exchange.

## The Angry Customer
An angry customer is yelling over the phone about a software malfunction that is jeopardizing an 

important project. The customer’s emotions have gotten the best of him/her. Try calming them down by 

apologizing and showing empathy for his/her situation – regardless of whether the company or customer 

is at fault. Then, attempt to resolve the issue.

of a newspaper, a magazine, or a software program.

I have an annual subscription for the Adobe Software programs.

Customer: This isn’t the first time your software has glitched out on me! I pay a lot of money to use this 

presentation tool, and if I don’t complete the project by tomorrow, I risk losing a major client!

### Scenario 1: The issue is on the client’s side

Representative: Sorry you’re experiencing this issue. That must be very frustrating. I’ve looked into your 

account and the problem seems to be that you’re using an older version of the software. I’ve sent you a 

link to the latest version. Please download it, try again, and notify us if you run into any issues. We’re 

always here to help.

### Scenario 2: The company’s at fault

Representative: Sorry you’re experiencing this issue. There’s a system-wide server error, but we can 

assure you that the issue will be fixed as soon as possible. Nonetheless, we understand the

inconvenience this is causing you. As an apology, please accept this 50% discount on your next month’s 

subscription fee.

`Nonetheless` `Nevertheless`, regardless of that.

## The Frugal Customer

A customer is keen on purchasing your product but has expressed dismay at the price. While prices are 

normally fixed, rather than simply dismissing the customer’s request with a “too bad, so sad” attitude, 

calmly justify the price by describing the product’s unique features. And if possible, find another way to 

ease the financial load, such as a free add-on or financing.

`Frugal`

节约;节俭的;节俭;节省的;节俭的, 朴素的 [ˈfruːɡl] noun  

opposite - big spender; money burns a hole in my pockets; i have cash to burn. spend money like water.

To be frugal means that you do not like spending money unnecessarily.

`Financing a car`

汽车（消费）贷款 noun  pay upfront,预付款

To finance a car means to take out a car loan from the bank. 

Zero percent financing means that you can get approved for finance without having to pay 

any interest.

`Steep`

`steep hill` 陡峭的山 - `gentle slope` 缓坡

A steep price means the price is too much.

$2000 for a new phone? That’s pretty steep. 

Customer: Hi there. I’d love to purchase this vehicle, but its price is well beyond my budget, 

so I’ll have to pass.

Representative: I understand that the price is steep for you, but this car is durable and fuel-efficient – it 

achieves up to 48 MPG on the highway. So the price is reasonable. Over time, if you count the money 

you save in gas and car repairs, you’ll see that the vehicle practically pays for itself! However, what we 

can offer you is 0% financing for the next 5 years. Would that work for you?

`MPG`: Mills per gallon

`KMPL`: Kilometes per liter 公里每升  liter: 升

### When You Don’t Know the Answer

A customer is keen on one of your top-selling products and wants to know when it’ll be back in stock. If 

you simply say “I don’t know” or “Check back later”, they might dismiss the purchase altogether. The best 

thing to do here is to assure them that you’ll get back to them with an answer. And before they potentially 

decide to go elsewhere, recommend alternative products that are in stock. For example:

`Out of stock`

脱销;无库存;已售完;缺货;断货 [aʊt əv stɑːk] oppisite is in stokc

Sorry, the item you’re looking for is out of stock. Can I help you find something else?

`Shipment`

We should get a shipment in later this month.

Would you like to be notified when the next shipment comes in?

Customer: Hello! I’m very interested in buying one of your down-feather jackets. The price is right, and 

it’s exactly what I’m looking for. But unfortunately, it is out of stock. Do you know when you’ll be getting 

more?

Representative: Hi there. We recently ran out, and unfortunately, we’re not sure when our new shipment 

will come in as it depends on our supplier. However, in the meantime, here is a link to our similar jackets. 

Please feel free to browse them. Either way, we will reach out to our supplier and notify you as soon as 

we receive a response. What is the best way to contact you?

`down-feather jackets` -> `down`, `down-feather`,`puffy`,`puffer jacket` 羽绒服

## The Defective-Product Customer

A customer comes into your store complaining about a recent purchase that is defective in some form. 

Rather than jumping to conclusions that effectively place the blame on the customer, try to empathize 

with them, as they’re likely disappointed over a purchase that they put a lot of thought into. The good 

news is that, in these situations, they’re usually looking for an exchange versus a refund. To seal the 

deal, show empathy by apologizing to the customer and providing them with an immediate solution.

`Defective` opposite is `effective` `flawed` 

有故障;缺陷;有缺陷;有缺陷的;不良品 [dɪˈfektɪv] adj.

This game seems to be defective, can I exchange it for a new one?

`swivel`,`pivot`,`spin`,`turn` 转

Never stand on a swivel chair.

Customer: Good afternoon! I recently purchased a swivel chair from your store, but every time I pivot, it 

makes a loud and bothersome squeak.

Representative: Yikes. We’re sorry to hear that. That must be really distracting. We don’t hear of this 

issue too often, so it might be due to a manufacturing defect. We’d be more than happy to send you a 

new one right away.

`Yikes` 哎呦,语气词

### When a Customer Violates Your Terms of Service

A customer has purchased a VPN service and – against the terms of services –has installed it on multiple 

devices. While it can be awkward to tell a paying customer that they’re in breach of your terms of service, 

there’s a way to go about it that both gets your point across and preserves their dignity. The key involves 

refraining from dubious assumptions. You need to determine their needs and attempt to fulfill them. For 

example:

`VPN`: virtual private network, hides your IP address- change your IP address to a new country.

`Breach`

破坏；辜负 [briːtʃ] verb

Breach an agreement. Breach a contract.

That was a breach of your contract. 

`beached whale`: 搁浅的鲸

`Dignity`

庄重;庄严;尊严;尊贵;高贵;高尚;自豪;自尊;自重 [ˈdɪɡnəti] noun 

Let them keep their dignity. Let them save face. 

`Dubious`

怀疑的;可疑的;半信半疑;不三不四;令人怀疑的 [ˈduːbiəs] adj.

Dubious means doubtful or suspicious. 

Their claim is rather dubious. 

Representative: Dear customer, we’re reaching out to you because we’ve noticed that you’ve installed 

our VPN software on multiple devices while registered with our single-device package. Were you planning 

on upgrading to one of our multi-device packages instead? Please let us know, and we’ll set you up with

the right package for your needs.
