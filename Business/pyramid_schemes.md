## What is a Pyramid Scheme?

`Recruit` – `Recruitment` – `Recruiter`

吸收（新成员）-人员招聘 - 招聘人员 [rɪˈkruːt] verb – noun – noun 

Pyramid schemes rely on recruiting others to make money. 

`Upline`

上线 noun

In a pyramid scheme, the people who recruited you are called your upline.

Your upline will pressure you into recruiting more people.

Any money you make in a pyramid scheme is funneled to your upline. 

`Downline `

下线 noun

In a pyramid scheme, the people you recruit are called your downline. 

In order to make money in a pyramid scheme, you will have to recruit a downline. 

A pyramid scheme funnels earnings from those on lower levels of an organization to 

the top, and are often associated with fraudulent operations.

The vast majority of pyramid schemes rely on profiting from recruitment fees and 

seldom involve the sale of actual goods or services with intrinsic value.

Multi-Level Marketing operations (MLMs) are similar in nature to pyramid schemes 

but differ in that they involve the sale of tangible goods. (More on MLMs later)

## An Example of a True Pyramid Scheme

In 2008, a massive pyramid scheme swept through Canada, promising citizens a

chance to get rich by selling low-cost travel club membership plans. To qualify, 

applicant "sellers" were first required to purchase memberships for themselves, at a 

costly $3,200 price tag. More than 2,000 folks brought out their cheque books, as 

they were promised $5,000 for each similar membership they sold. However, profits 

could only be realized when applicant members accumulated $100,000 in sales, 

which entailed selling at least 20 membership plans. But this proved virtually 

impossible in a downward economy, where people fiercely clung to their 

money. Consequently, aggrieved investors filed a class-action lawsuit, resulting in the 

return of their money, and the dismantling of the scheme.

## How the Pyramid Tumbles

Pyramid schemes are viable as long as the lowest levels remain wider than the upper 

ones. But once the lowest levels shrink, the entire structure collapses. By nature of

exponential math, it's just plain impossible for pyramids to sustain forever, and 

somewhere in the chain, people will invariably lose their money. Interestingly, even 

high-level early adopters may lose money near the end, due to conditions that delay 

their payments from underlings, which often require waiting periods.

Pyramid schemes are illegal in many countries. The model of profiting by using the 

network effect often traps individuals into recruiting their acquaintances, which can 

feel slimy for everyone involved and can ultimately strain relationships. Investors 

would be wise to avoid such schemes.

## How to spot a Pyramid Scheme?

`Turn a profit`

获利 [tɜːrn ə ˈprɑːfɪt] noun

Turn a profit means to make a profit, to earn a profit.

Only 1% of people in a pyramid scheme are able to turn a profit. It’s a terrible 

business investment. 

If a business opportunity relies on you recruiting new members in order to turn a 

profit, then it’s a pyramid scheme. 99% of people in pyramid schemes lose money. 

Any money made in a pyramid scheme is funneled up to the top 1%. 

## MLM – Multi-Level Marketing

`Multi-Level Marketing`

多层式直销;多层次营销;多层次销售 [ˈmʌlti ˈlevl ˈmɑːrkɪtɪŋ] noun

Multi-Level Marketing companies are pyramid schemes that hide the fact they are a 

pyramid scheme with the sale of products. 

They are often referred to as MLMs. 

`Direct sales`

直接销售 [dəˈrekt ˈseɪlz] noun

Direct sales is when a product is sold directly to the customer instead of being sold at 

a store.

MLM companies are often called direct sales, because the products are sold to 

distributors who then directly sell it to the customer. 

`Sales representative` – `sales rep`. 

销售代表;业务代表;銷售代表;销售代理;营业代表 [ˈseɪlz ˌreprɪˈzentətɪv] noun

an employee of a company who travels around a particular area selling the 

company's goods to shops/stores, etc.

People involved in MLM companies often call themselves sales reps.

`Consultant`

顾问;高级顾问医师;会诊医师 [kənˈsʌltənt] noun

a person who knows a lot about a particular subject and is employed to give advice

about it to other people.

Some MLMs refer to their sales reps as consults. Ex. Mary Kay consultant. 

`Distributor`

经销商;分销商;(发动机的)配电器，配电盘 [dɪˈstrɪbjətər] noun

a person or company that supplies goods to shops/stores, etc.

MLM sales reps are also called distributors. 

The most common type of pyramid scheme is an MLM. Most MLM companies will 

claim that: 

1. They cannot be a pyramid scheme because pyramid schemes are illegal. 
2. Our consultants sell a real product and earn money by selling this product, 

therefore we are not a pyramid scheme. 

This is false however. Consultants in MLM companies make little to no money by 

selling the actual product. In order to turn a profit in an MLM company the consultants 

must recruit a downline. 

This is a list of popular MLM companies in the US.
* Mary Kay
* Avon
* Herbalife
* Young Living
* Doterra 
* Scentsy 
* Beach Body
* Monat
* Younique
* Amway
* Tupperware
* NuSkin
* Primerica
* LuLaRoe
* Arbonne 

Avoid these companies. Avoid purchasing their products. If you even purchase these 

products the sales rep./consultant will likely try to recruit you into their downline. 

MLM products also tend to be way overpriced. The products must be overpriced in 

order to pay the distributors and the distributors upline. 

Popular Chinese MLM companies. 
* Infinitus
* Perfect
* QuanJian
* JoyMain
* New Era

In most MLM companies 99% of distributors lost money. Only the top 1% makes 

money. If 99% of people are losing money, then how does company keep going? Why 

don’t people just leave the MLM sooner?

Because MLMs are a commercial cult. The members are brainwashed by their upline 

into believing that if they just work harder, they will be able to join the top 1%. These 

companies hold massive events and invite motivational speakers to keep people 

chasing the dream. 

MLM recruiters are often desperate to sell their products and/or recruit new members. Below 

are some actual conversations with MLM recruiters and memes about the MLM culture.
