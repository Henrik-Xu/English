# Ponzi Schemes

## What is a Ponzi Scheme?

`Invest` – `investment` - `investor`

投资;(把资金)投入 [ɪnˈvest] verb – noun – noun 

to spend money on something in order to make it better or more successful.

Ponzi schemes rely on a constant flow of new investors. 

Once investment in the scheme stops or slows down, the scheme collapses. 

`Return` 

投资回报 [rɪˈtɜːrn ɑːn] 

Ponzi schemes promise high returns, but regular investments can’t guarantee high 

returns. 

If an investment guarantees high returns… be very cautious. 

`Robbing Peter to pay Paul`

拆东墙补西墙 [ˈrɑːbɪŋ ˈpiːtər tu peɪ pɔ:l] phrase 

Ponzi schemes are often referred to as robbing Peter to pay Paul.

Meaning you take new money from Peter to pay back money to Paul. 

A Ponzi scheme is an investment scam. Investors are convinced to invest in a 

fraudulent business. The investor is promised a high return rate, higher than what a

regular bank would normally provide. 

When a person invests in a company the company usually pays returns to that person 

with actual profits earned. So, for a normal investment, people will earn money some

years and lose money or stay even other years depending on the market.

A Ponzi scheme does not earn real profits. Instead, the operators of the Ponzi 

scheme continue to bring in new investors to pay the returns of the old investors.

These schemes are also referred to as “robbing Peter to pay Paul”. 

Ponzi schemes like pyramid schemes are highly unstable and likely to collapse. 

## How the Ponzi scheme collapses 

`Investment capital`

投资资本 [ɪnˈvestmənt ˈkæpɪtl] noun

Investment capital is the money invested into a company for the company to further 

its goals. The investment capital is usually used to purchase new operating 

equipment and things of that nature. 

`Bank run`/ `run on the bank`

银行挤兑;向银行挤提存款 [rʌn ɑːn ðə bæŋk] phrase 

A bank run or run on the bank is when many people panic and try to withdraw all their 

money from the bank at once.

`Fictitious` 

虚构的;想像的;纯属虚构;虚假的;编造的 [fɪkˈtɪʃəs] adj.

Fictitious means untrue, fake, not real. 

`funnels`: 漏斗

`fraudulent`: 欺诈的

`intrinsic`: real, 固有的

`tangible`: 有形的

`dividend`: 股息；股利

`collapse`: fall down; fall apart

`conman`: 骗子

`orchestrated`: 精心设计的

`zillion`; `gazillion` 无数的

`quadrillion`: 千万亿

`trillion`: 万亿

The Ponzi scheme can only continue as long as new clients are investing money. As 

soon as the scheme can no longer bring in new clients the whole thing begins to 

collapse. Previous investors will not longer receive their returns, and they will attempt

to withdraw their investment. Some lucky people might successfully withdraw their 

investment, but the majority of investments will be lost.

Typically, if a Ponzi scheme is not stopped by authorities, it usually falls apart for one 

or more of the following reasons:

1. The operator vanishes, taking all the remaining investment money. Promoters 

who intend to run often attempt to do so as returns due to be paid are about to 

exceed new investments, as this is when the investment capital available will 

be at its maximum.

2. Since the scheme requires a continual stream of investments to fund higher 

returns, if the number of new investors slows down, the scheme collapses as 

the operator can no longer pay the promised returns (the higher the returns, 

the greater the risk of the Ponzi scheme collapsing). Such liquidity crises often 

trigger panics, as more people start asking for their money, similar to a bank 

run.

3. External market forces, such as a sharp decline in the economy, can often 

hasten the collapse of a Ponzi scheme (for example, the Madoff investment 

scandal during the market downturn of 2008), since they often cause many 

investors to attempt to withdraw part or all of their funds sooner than they had 

intended.

Actual losses are extremely difficult to calculate. The amounts that investors thought 

they had were never attainable in the first place. The wide gap between "money in" 

and "fictitious gains" make it virtually impossible to know how much was lost in any 

Ponzi scheme.

## How to spot a Ponzi Scheme?

`Skeptical` 

怀疑的;心存疑惑的;将信将疑的 [ˈskeptɪkl] adj.

Skeptical or sceptical means to be suspicious of something, to not trust something. 

If something sounds too good to be true, you should be skeptical.

If you hear about an investment opportunity with high return rates, be very skeptical. 

Research the company thoroughly. Quite often early investors will spread the word to 

their friends. If your friend tells you about an investment opportunity that’s too good 

to be true, it probably is.

`Yield `

出产（作物）；产生（收益、效益等）；提供 [jiːld]verb

to produce or provide something, for example a profit, result or crop.

Many Ponzi schemes share common characteristics. Look for these warning signs:

* High returns with little or no risk. Every investment carries some degree of 

risk, and investments yielding higher returns typically involve more risk. Be 

highly suspicious of any “guaranteed” investment opportunity.

* Overly consistent returns. Investments tend to go up and down over time. Be 

skeptical about an investment that regularly generates positive returns 

regardless of overall market conditions.

* Unregistered investments. Ponzi schemes typically involve investments that 

are not registered with the SEC or with state regulators. Registration is 

important because it provides investors with access to information about the 

company’s management, products, services, and finances.

* Unlicensed sellers. Federal and state securities laws require investment 

professionals and firms to be licensed or registered. Most Ponzi schemes 

involve unlicensed individuals or unregistered firms.

* Secretive, complex strategies. Avoid investments if you don’t understand 

them or can’t get complete information about them.

* Issues with paperwork. Account statement errors may be a sign that funds 

are not being invested as promised.

* Difficulty receiving payments. Be suspicious if you don’t receive a payment 

or have difficulty cashing out. Ponzi scheme promoters sometimes try to 

prevent participants from cashing out by offering even higher returns for 

staying put.

## Origins of the Ponzi Scheme

`Coin`

创造(新词语) [kɔɪn] verb

To coin a word is to create a new word. 

The term Ponzi scheme was coined after Mr. Ponzi. However, Ponzi schemes have 

been around since before him. 

`Swindler`

骗子 noun

A swindler is a liar, cheater, deceiver, or thief. A person who will cheat you out of 

money. A person who will scam you.

The term "Ponzi Scheme" was coined after a swindler named Charles Ponzi in 1919. 

However, the first recorded instances of this sort of investment scam can be traced 

back to the mid-to-late 1800s, and were orchestrated by Adele Spitzeder in Germany 

and Sarah Howe in the United States. In fact, the methods of what came to be known 

as the Ponzi Scheme were described in two separate novels written by Charles 

Dickens, Martin Chuzzlewit, published in 1844 and Little Dorrit in 1857.

## The Polka King Ponzi Scheme

Reality is often stranger than fiction. 

First of all, what is Polka? 

Polka is a type of music and dance popular in many European countries. Polka music 

is popular in North America among older European immigrants. 

The Polka King, Jan Lewan, was a Polish immigrant who was a singer in a popular polka band 

in Pennsylvania, America. His dream was to come to America and become rich and famous. 

Polka music does not pay well. Although he was the singer of the most popular polka band, this 

was not going to get him rich and famous. So, he eventually began a Ponzi scheme. 

The investors in his Ponzi scheme were fans of polka music. They were elderly immigrants in 

their 60s. 

Lewan owned and operated a gift store in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. When he would tour back in 

Poland, he would bring back jewelry and other goods to sell in the store. To support the store, 

he also sold shares in the business and promised returns of 12 percent and 20 percent to 

investors, many of whom had traveled with him. The state of Pennsylvania warned him to stop 

selling securities, but he continued. In 2004 Lewan was arrested for defrauding some 400 

people in 22 states of millions of dollars. Lewan was sentenced to five years and 11 months 

imprisonment by a federal court judge.

While in prison in Delaware in 2004, Lewan was stabbed in the neck by a cellmate. He was 

taken to a nearby hospital and was sent back to prison several days later. The perpetrator of the 

stabbing had 15 years added to his sentence. Lewan was released from prison in 2009.

There are 3 different films about this odd story. First in the 2007 TV documentary Mystery of the 

Polka King, the 2009 documentary film The Man Who Would Be Polka King, and the 2017 

American comedy film The Polka King, in which Lewan is portrayed by Jack Black.
