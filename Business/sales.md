## Sales Language to avoid
`Leading Question`

引导性问题 [ˈliːdɪŋ ˈkwestʃən] noun

A leading question is a question that you ask in a particular way in order to get the answer 

you want. It’s similar to a rhetorical question. 

Ex. Wouldn’t you? Don’t you?

`rhetorical question` :a question you already know the answer.

`Prospect`

预期客户，有潜力的顾客 [ˈprɑːspekt] noun; prospective client

A prospect is a potential customer. 

`Manipulate`

（暗中）控制，操纵，影响 [məˈnɪpjuleɪt] verb

To manipulate is to control or strongly influence someone.

Generally speaking, people don’t like to be manipulated.

**Excessive use of leading questions will turn off your prospect.**

Statements like, "you'd really like to make a good impression, wouldn't you?"

Used once in the right context this is okay but repeated use of phrases like "wouldn't you" and "don't you" 

indicate to the prospect that you are trying to manipulate them.

**Comments like "don't worry about it" essentially tell the customer that you have dismissed their**

**concerns as not being important.**

Until the customer feels confident you understand their needs, they simply will not buy. Similarly, "yes ... 

but", is a phrase to be avoided as it shows little respect for your prospect's opinion. *More on Yes… but, 

later.*

**Avoid using lazy or inappropriate sales language.**

Salespeople often say, "you know what I mean?" or the dreaded "you follow me?".

Presumably these sales people think they are inviting questions from the prospect, however, it is quite 

likely the customer is thinking "of course I know what you mean, I'm not stupid!"

The customer feels belittled rather than acknowledged and this doesn't help make sales.

`belittled`

to make someone fell little, feel umimportant.

### A Better Way
A better way for a salesperson to invite questions from the prospect is to ask questions like,

"What do you think about that?"

Or

"Is that applicable in your industry"

or

"I hope I've explained that well.” Instead of “Do you know what I mean?”

Or

"Does that raise any questions in your mind?"

or 

**"Did I explain that well? I don't know if i was clear or not."**

### Think About What You Say
Think about the use of the word "contract" as distinct from the word "agreement". Would you rather sign 

an agreement or sign a contract?

Contract sound much more formal and may well invite the introduction of legal people to the sales 

scenario.

Think about your synonyms, and which synonym sounds more inviting. 

Ex.

Deal, discount, or bargain? 

`Deal`

经营，买卖（某一产品）; 作为…的依据加以接受; 发牌;非法买卖毒品;贩毒 [diːl] noun

Deal has many different meanings, most are positive like deal cards, or get a deal on 

something. But some are negative like drug deal or deal with a problem. 

a steal of deal.

`Discount`

折扣; 认为…不重要;对…不全信;低估;打折扣;打折出售 [ˈdɪskaʊnt , dɪsˈkaʊnt] noun, verb

Discount most commonly means an amount of money that is taken off the usual cost of 

something.

It is overall a more positive word than deal.

`Bargain`

减价品;便宜货;协议;交易; 讨价还价，商讨条件 [ˈbɑːrɡən] noun, verb; bargain basement;

As a noun bargain has the same meaning as discount. But as a verb bargain means to 

haggle to get a better price.  `haggle`: 讨价还价

This word is usually negative because if something is a bargain, does that mean it ’s not 

worth full price? A bargain item is usually a cheap product. 

Let me give you a deal. 

Let me give you a discount. 

Let me give you a bargain. 

Which one do you think sounds best?

### How Many Times Do You Have to Make an Offer
The average person in the USA needs to hear or see something 3 - 5 times to be convinced.

It's no accident that the TV Direct Commercials keep repeating their offer using words like "but wait

there's more" or "don't buy yet becasue...". And if you count, you'll find they repeat the offer 3 to 5 times.

The best salespeople often close their sales after the fifth "No". This is because the salesperson has 

effectively had the prospect think about using their product or service enough times to make a decision. 

## Positive Persuasion NOT Negative
### Turn negative persuasion words into positive ones ?

" yes... but "

It really is not a very good persuasion word to use with a customer.

You see, " but " negates everything that has been said before it.

It works like a mental eraser.

Imagine saying to your spouse,

" You look beautiful in that but …"

( look out! Be very careful what your next words are!)

"You have done a great job on that proposal but …"

How would you feel if your boss came up to you and said that?

Perhaps, like the next words would be,

" ... I want you to do it all again ".

So, if I can't use "yes ...but" what do I use?

### Because
Did you know that .."BECAUSE"..is a very powerful persuasion word ?

An experiment by Harvard social psychologist Ellen Langer proved the point.

A well-known principle of human behaviour says that when we ask someone to do us a favour, we will be 

more successful if we provide a reason.

People simply like to have reasons for what they do.

Example:

"Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the copy machine because I'm in a rush?"

The effectiveness of this request-plus-reason was nearly total:

94 percent of those asked let her skip ahead of them in line.

Compare this success rate to the results when she made the following request?

"Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the copy machine?"

Under those circumstances, only 60 percent of those asked complied.

At first glance, it appears that the crucial difference between the two requests was the additional 

information provided by the words "because I'm in a rush."

Instead of including a real reason for compliance, Langer's third type of request used the persuasion word 

"because" and then, adding nothing new, merely restated the obvious:

"Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the copy machine because I have to make some copies?"

The result was that once again nearly all (93 percent) agreed, even though no real reason, no new 

information, was added to justify their compliance.

## A Response to Too Expensive
A typical comment that a customer is likely to offer is,

"Your product is too expensive."

For years my standard response to that question was,

"Compared to what?"

Well, that’s not a bad question.

My intention at the time was to make sure the customer was comparing apples to apples.

I could follow that up with some other questions to determine what was important to the 

customer,

i.e. their criteria for buying, or not.

(a customer’s criteria is what is most important to them and if you can frame your 

communication about the benefits of your product around their criteria your words will have 

greater impact.)

The problem with “Compared to what?” is that it focuses the mind of the buyer on the 

competition.

Logic would suggest that you need your product in the mind of your potential client rather than 

your competitor’s product and that's where the language of persuasion comes in.

## Better Responses
Better responses to “Your product is too expensive“ might be :

"How do you know our product is too expensive?"

This will give you the perceived shortcomings of your offer in relation to the buyer’s criteria.

Example

Prospect says,

"Your product is too expensive."

Your response,

"Wow, let me get this right, you have thought our product was too expensive.

(moving objection into the past and hinting that the person could think differently)

Amazing, I haven't heard that for a long time. When I've spoken to clients who had thought our 

product was too expensive it usually turned out that the buyer hadn't considered XY & Z.

Just suppose, you used our product and you noticed improvement in your business in the areas 

of XY & Z.

(Moving prospect's thoughts into the future and having successfully used your product or 

service).

That would be a good result for your business, wouldn't it?

(Associate them to the good feelings.)

And, as you think about those positive outcomes now, how differently are you feeling about 

using our product?"

(Moving positive future feeling to now and also suggesting they'll be feeling differently in the 

present.)
