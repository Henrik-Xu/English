## Common roadblocks from discussing gender and racial issues.

### Gender differences don’t matter—I view women and men equally.
Research confirms that workplaces are not meritocracies. Gender bias, discrimination, and 

sexism are still a reality for many women, especially women of color. Although you may not 

have experienced these issues personally, it’s always good to realize that others in your

workplace may have.

### We don’t see color—only people.
Everyone sees skin color—it’s a human reality. But this isn’t a bad thing. In fact, for people to 

feel included and do their best work, they have to be able to bring their full selves to work, 

including their racial/ethnic identity. Our differences should be honored and celebrated, not

ignored.

### Race and ethnicity do not matter in certain places.
Our racial and ethnic backgrounds are a huge part of who we are, and they influence how we 

view the world. Today’s globalized workplaces are not homogenous —and diverse viewpoints, 

experiences, and identities are an asset.

`ethnicity`: 种族 `homogenous`: 同种类的

`braids`;`cornrows`;`deadlocks`:Afro hair style

## Common racial discrimination in the workplace.
### Asking a black woman to change her hairstyle.
One example of racial discrimination that black women often face is being asked to change their 

natural hairstyle. Black women are constantly told that their natural hair is unprofessional and 

that they should straighten it to have a more professional look. Can you imagine reversing the 

roles? Imagine telling a white or Asian woman that her straight hair is unprofessional and that 

she needs to curl it every day for work in order to look more professional.

### Here are 9 more examples of discrimination.
1. Discrimination based on gender

    “My boss told me we don’t hire men because we are worried the girls will flirt with them.”

2. Discrimination based on physical or mental disability

    “I work with people with autism spectrum disorder. They apply for jobs that they have the skills 

    to do but bosses won’t give them a chance because of their disability.”

3. Discrimination based on perceived sexual orientation

    “My manager interviewed someone and told me she decided not to hire him because his voice 

    was too high-pitched and gay sounding. She thought it would get annoying if he worked here.”

4. Discrimination based on where you were born

    “At work, the immigrant workers are always given the dirty jobs that no one else wants to do. 

    Even though my coworkers and I have the same jobs and amount of experience, I am always 

    expected to do the jobs that no else will do.”

5. Discrimination based on family status

    “I was applying for a job and the interviewer kept trying to find out if I had any kids. I managed to 

    keep dodging the questions but they were very persistent. I have heard that the company 

    doesn’t like to hire new moms because new moms are reluctant to work late or overtime.”

6. Discrimination based on ancestry 

    “I work with multicultural youth. Many of them have a hard time getting a job. I worry that they 

    don’t get called back because of their ethnic names. I’ve read about employers discriminating 

    based on names.”

7. Discrimination based on race

    “My boss told me that we had a bad experience hiring an Aboriginal employee in the past and 

    now we won’t hire anyone that is Aboriginal because it’s too risky.”

8. Discrimination based on age

    “I’ve heard people at work complain about hiring older people because they can’t learn new 

    technology and they’re just going to retire soon anyways.”

9. Discrimination based on religion

    “I was on a hiring committee, and we interviewed a woman who wore a headscarf. After the 

    interview, someone said we shouldn’t hire her because the headscarf is a safety concern. I told 

    them that there was safety equipment we could easily buy to accommodate her. My manager 

    said it wasn’t worth the hassle and decided not to hire her.”

## How to prevent workplace discrimination
1. Develop a written policy that defines rules and procedures. Creating a clearly-written 

policy is the first step toward preventing discrimination at work. This is just one of the 

reasons it is important to develop an employee handbook. Every handbook should include a 

policy on discrimination that every employee receives and signs an acknowledgment of 

receipt. Your policy should cover a broad range of potential discriminatory acts and include 

a protocol that outlines how discrimination complaints are submitted, handled, and resolved.

2. Establish a consistent process for resolving discrimination issues. Resolving issues 

quickly and fairly is incredibly important—even if your business isn’t in legal jeopardy, a 

lingering workplace discrimination issue can lead to losing trust and credibility with your 

employees. Consistency in how you address and resolve issues shows that you expect 

everyone to be treated fairly and by the same standards regarding discrimination. While 

there is no single “right” procedure for workplace discrimination, it’s important to establish a 

process that fits your organization’s size, structure, and resources.

3. Continually educate employees on their role in preventing discrimination. For most 

businesses, addressing the issue in the employee handbook and onboarding process isn’t 

enough. Some state laws require employers to regularly conduct anti-discrimination training 

programs. Whether you’re required by law or you want to be more proactive about avoiding 

discrimination, it’s important to ensure that employees are aware of your policies and 

procedures and know how to report allegations. It’s also recommended that you conduct a 

separate or enhanced program for supervisory or managerial employees, as they are often 

your first line of defense in preventing workplace discrimination.
