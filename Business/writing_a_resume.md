# Writing a Resume
Keep your resume to one page. Hiring managers have to read hundreds of resumes. 

If you resume is several pages long the hiring manager will feel that it’s 

TL;DR – too long; didn’t read.

Customize your resume to the field that you are applying for. Different fields will 

prioritize different information. For some fields certifications would be more important 

and other fields professional experience is more important. 

`Prioritize`

优先顺序;优先化;优先考虑;优先排序;優先順序 [praɪˈɔːrətaɪz] 

to put tasks, problems, etc. in order of importance, so that you can deal with the most 

important first. 

Which task would you like me to prioritize? 

## Tips for each section of the resume
1. Career objective/ Resume objective

Start your resume with your career goals. You can give a brief introduction of yourself 

and your skills and how you want to use those skil ls in this job. 

Remember that these short blurbs provide a concise summary of your background, 

skills, and qualifications. In order to write one, you can break them down into three 

sentences:

* Sentence 1: Announce your title and the number of years of work experience you have.
* Sentence 2: Describe unique skills or qualities relevant to your target position.
* Sentence 3: List any certifications or credentials needed for the role.

`Blurb`

（书籍封面的）简介；（生产商等的）产品推介 [blɜːrb] noun

A short description of a book, a new product, etc., written by the people who have 

produced it, that is intended to attract your attention and make you want to buy it .

Ideally you should get it down to a 30 second blurb.

`Relevant`

紧密相关的;切题的;有价值的;有意义的 [ˈreləvənt] adj.

Closely connected with the subject you are discussing or the situation you are 

thinking about.

Only add relevant information to your resume.

2. Show your professional experience

Start your resume by stating your years of experience in the industry and the main

duties you performed. When deciding what duties to add, use the job description as 

your guide. For instance, if the job you are applying to emphasizes cost-benefit 

analysis, then add any applicable duties to your professional experience.

`Quantify`

量化;定量;确定数量 [ˈkwɑːntɪfaɪ] verb

to describe or express something as an amount or a number.

You should quantify your work experience to make it easier to understand. 

You should quantify your professional experience.

* How many years did you work there?
* How many customers did you serve?
* For teachers, how many students did you teach per class?
* For accountants, how much money did you manage?

Above all, your resume should be achievement oriented. Do not repeat bullet points, 

or list bland and meaningless duties.

`Bullet points`

点句重要项目(文件中列举时用正方形、菱形等点句符开始);点句符;项目符号 [ˈbʊlɪt pɔɪnt] noun

A bullet point is one of a series of important items for discussion or action in a document, 

usually marked by a square or round symbol.

For your job experience you should add bullet points to state what your job duties were.

`Bland`

平淡的；乏味的 [blænd] adj.

With little colour, excitement or interest; without anything to attract attention .

Your resume looks professional, but it’s a little bland. 

The candidate in the sample above quantified their resume in three places (shown in bold):

* Trained and supervised 2 new employees, ensuring they maintain fastidious attention to detail

* Create financial reports and supported all areas of responsibility within a 5-person finance team

* Manage a $350,000 budget, with a reduction of costs totaling 15% over two years

Below are a few words and phrases you should leave off your resume because they don't add 

any new information. You don't have much time to make hiring managers understand why they 

should consider you as a candidate, so avoid taking up space with words like “people person.” 

Nearly every job will require you to work with other people, so unless you have a specific 

example that shows you are exceptionally skilled in this area, it's not worth including.

Here are a few additional examples of phrases hiring managers expect without needing to see 

them on your resume:

* Hard worker
* Self-motivated
* Team player

`fastidious`: 一丝不苟的；严谨的； hypecritical

Here are more examples of self-promotional phrases to avoid:

* Go-getter or proactive: A go-getter is someone who takes initiative and action. To prove 

this on a resume, consider listing additional certification or extracurricular activities. This can 

also be proven by showcasing ways you've reached out to other departments to help achieve 

overall goals. Consider using a phrase such as, "Initiated conversation with accounting team 

to determine where the biggest revenue losses were to help devise a strategy."

* Go-to person: Be sure to showcase your subject matter expertise by proving why you were 

the go-to person for a particular topic or department. This can be stated by saying something 

such as, "Lead lunch-and-learn programs on digital marketing for knowledge transferring 

sessions with other departments."

* Strategic thinker: A strategic thinker is someone who comes up with successful plans and 

puts them into action. Using this skill can help save a company time and money. For certain 

positions like those in digital marketing, being a strategic thinker is very important as it 

enables you to find opportunities to improve and plan out your future campaigns. To prove 

you possess this skill, consider including language that demonstrates you performed 

research on a particular subject and implemented a plan. An example of this would be, 

"Created persona-based social media posts for customers, resulting in 40% growth in 

engagement."

* Think outside the box: It is one thing to say you can think outside the box and another to 

prove how you have done this. Think back on a time that you were able to introduce a new 

procedure or creative marketing campaign for a company. Include specific examples of how 

this was able to be achieved.

* Results-driven: There are particular roles like sales, where being results-driven is of 

particular importance. To prove this on a resume, try showcasing how you have exceeded 

targets or goals. Using numbers here would also be incredibly beneficial. An example of this 

would be "Exceeded sales quota by an average of 6% year over year."

* Detail-oriented: Paying attention to detail is incredibly important in roles such as content 

creation, accounting, engineering, or any medical field. Besides handing over a meticulous 

resume, be sure to include examples of how you have been detail-oriented in the past. An 

example of this could be, "Reviewed all work at least twice before handing in ahead of

schedule."

`meticulous`: 一丝不苟的，细心的，严谨的

professional experience.

3. Show your Education, Certifications, and other credentials.

Depending on the field credentials can be very important. This information should be

easy to find on the resume and easy to read. 

4. Show off any additional skills.

What kind of skills should you include on your resume? Avoid hobbies and interests 

— instead, focus on your hard and soft skills and achievements that are relevant to

the job.

If you are well versed in Microsoft Office Applications and it is relevant to the job 

you’re looking for, then list it. 

* Knowledge of Oracle, SAGE, and all Microsoft Office Applications
* Excellent communication skills, and ability to present complex information in an easy to understand format

`well versed`: skilled

`job hopping`: 跳槽，changing jobs frequently
