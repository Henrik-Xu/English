# Resigning from a job

## How to write a resignation letter

`HR` – `Human Resources`

（公司的）人力资源部，人事部 [ˈhjuːmən ˈriːsɔːrsɪz] noun

the department in a company that deals with employing and training people.

To resign you need to write a letter to HR.

You’ll need to talk to Human Resource about that. 

Writing a resignation letter can be a simple process if you follow a few key steps. 

Before writing your letter, you should consult with your direct supervisor or HR 

manager to follow any processes your company has in place regarding resignations. 

For example, they might ask you to provide specific information or send your letter to 

certain people at the company. Follow these steps to write a resignation letter:

1. Record the time and date

`Time stamp`

时间戳;时间标记;以时戳;时间印章;时戳 [taɪm stæmp] noun

When a message has a time and date attached to it, that’s called a time stamp.

Text messages, WeChat messages, WhatsApp messages, and emails all have time 

stamps. 

What’s the time stamp on that message?

In a standard business letter, it's typical to include the time, date and a few other 

details to keep a record of time stamps. In an email, this information is not necessary

as it is digitally available. If you are planning to type a letter, you should include this 

information at the top of the page.

2. Start with an address line

Address the recipient by name. You can use introductions like “Dear,” “Hello,” or 

simply “Mr./Ms. [supervisor's last name].”

3. Include a statement of resignation

Clearly state that you are writing to submit your formal resignation from the company. 

If you'd like, you can include your position title as well.

4. List your last day of work

While it is standard to provide two weeks' notice, your company might have specific 

instruction around what your last date of work should be. After getting this information 

from a direct manager, list the date and weekday of your final day at the company.

5. Add a statement of gratitude

`Foster`

促进；助长；培养；鼓励 [ˈfɑːstər] verb;  Foster Family;

to encourage something to develop.

It is always a good career decision to keep your relationships positive. Writing one or 

two sentences explaining what you are thankful for about your time at the company 

will help foster a peaceful transition.

6. List next steps or important information

`Transition`

过渡；转变；变革；变迁 [trænˈzɪʃn] noun

the process or a period of changing from one state or condition to another.

List any key information the recipient should be aware of regarding your transition. 

These details can be worked out with your manager ahead of time. If you're not sure 

of what to write, simply adding that you are happy to do whatever you can to make 

the transition as smooth as possible will be appreciated.

7. Close with your signature

Finish the letter by signing your name after a closing statement like “Sincerely,” or 

“Thank you.”

`Don't burn your bridges` equals to `Don's bite the hand that's feed you`

`lay the foundation`: `building the basics`; `pave the way for`

`graduate`: can be short for `grad`; `undergraduate` can be short for `undergrad`

## Tips for writing a resignation letter

Here are several tips you can use to make your resignation letter as effective as 

possible:

* Keep it positive. Regardless of the reasons you're resigning, the tone of this 

letter should be positive—aim to part on good terms and maintain your 

professional network. Above all, do not use your resignation letter to vent 

frustration.

* Deliver your letter in person. If possible, you may want to deliver your 

resignation letter in person to your manager. If you resign with a hard copy, be 

sure to include the date at the top of the letter. You may also send an email. 

Use a subject line that's clear and direct, such as: Resignation—[Your Name].

* Keep it brief. If you are leaving your company for sensitive reasons and prefer 

not to provide optional details, simply include your statement of resignation, 

last day at the company and a statement like “I wish the company success in 

its future endeavors.”

* Plan for an immediate departure. In certain situations, your employer may 

ask you to leave on the day you resign. Pay attention to what happens when 

others resign and plan accordingly when you are determining your start date in 

a new job.

* Follow your manager's instructions for next steps. After you submit a 

formal resignation, your manager might ask you to put together a transition 

plan, finish up certain projects or write a goodbye note to your colleagues.
