* What is your greatest strength?
* What is your greatest weakness?
* Tell me about a challenge you had to overcome at your last job.
* How do you approach a typical workday?

When you practice your answer to these common questions, you can deliver more confident 

responses. If you can, practice with a trusted friend or family member who can give you 

feedback. You can also practice your facial expressions and body language in front of a mirror.
