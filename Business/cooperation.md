## Dialogue Practice
James is having issues getting a promotion. Carol is trying to give him some advice.
```
Carol James, what's wrong? You seem upset.
James It's the second time I lost the chance to be promoted. And to be honest, I don't know 
what I am doing wrong! I've completed all of my tasks successfully and on time!
Carol I am sorry to hear that. But you know, sometimes, work is more than just completing your 
tasks. You need to show some initiative and have vision! If I were you, I would try to come up 
with some new ideas and methods and present them to the boss. They may not always be 
worth implementing, but it'll show you are doing more than just what you're told.
James You may be right. It can also show that I can work independently and responsibly, and 
those are important qualities.
Carol Exactly. You need to learn the ropes quickly. Try to learn from your superiors, or leaders 
in other departments.
James I'll try to do all that. Thanks for the pointers, Carol!
Carol You're welcome. And here's one last piece of advice: be confident! You can do it!
```

Why?

company?

James Hey Jessica! Why so glum? What’s wrong?
Jessica I just had a talk with the boss. Apparently, I'm doing a lousy job.
James What? You know that's not true! You're doing a great job! Did he actually say that? What 
happened?
Jessica Well, he didn't say it, but that's what he meant. He mentioned that I had made a couple 
of mistakes in my last two reports. And he's right. And I was a bit slow on the last project and 
failed to meet the deadline.
James Oh, come on! That can happen to the best of us! It's not the end of the world. We all 
make mistakes sometimes. He just wanted to bring it to your attention, so that you can do even 
better in the future.
Jessica The thing is, I was having a really tough time at home and I just couldn't concentrate.
James Well, we all have our ups and downs. You know that you are doing great, and no one 
could ever replace you. You're the best at what you do. So don't let something like this get you 
down.
Jessica Thanks for the support, James. I guess you're right. I just need to focus more, and it 
will be okay.
