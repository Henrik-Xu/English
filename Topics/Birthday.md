## Dialog – making birthday plans
```
A: Your birthday is this month right?
B: It sure is. It’s on the 21st
.
A: Do you have any plans? Are you gonna have a birthday party?
B: No, no plans yet. I usually don’t celebrate my birthday.
A: No way. Let me throw you a party!
B: Oh please don’t. I don’t want to bother you.
A: It’s no bother. We can have a simple little party at my place. Just let me know who to invite!
B: Really? Are you sure?
A: Yeah, of course I’m sure! You have to celebrate your birthday!
B: Okay, but make sure you tell people gifts are optional. I don’t want everyone to feel like they
have to bring me a present.
A: Okay, no problem. What kind of cake do you want?
B: I don’t have much of a sweet tooth, so just a vanilla cake will be fine.
A: Okay, and you’re turning 26 right?
B: Yes, haha are you gonna put 26 candles on the cake?
A: I’m gonna try!! I don’t think they’ll all fit though!
B: Probably not. The number candles would be fine too.

## Homework:
Describe your best birthday experience

You should say:
* What you did
* Who was with you
* How you celebrated
```
My best birthday experience was my 22nd birthday. That year I had a few very close friends in
Beijing. I planned out my birthday party, including where we would celebrate and what party
favors we would have.
There’s this idea in American culture that your friends should plan a birthday party for you. Well
up until that year I had always felt rather disappointed when my friends did not plan a fabulous
birthday party for me.
That year I had a conversation with a friend who pointed out to me how ridiculous it is to expect
your friends to plan a birthday party for you every single year. That’s when I realized that if I
wanted a nice birthday party then I would just have to plan it myself. And the focus really
shouldn’t be on me, the focus should be more on getting my friends together to have some fun.
Since that year I have chosen to stick to that birthday philosophy. I don’t want my friends and
family to feel pressure to buy me something nice or plan a big party for me. I just want us all to
get together and have a nice time.
