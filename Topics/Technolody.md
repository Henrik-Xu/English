## Dialog – Discuss screen time
```
A: Hey, how much screen time do you let your kids have?
B: How much time? Well… I dunno I never really paid attention.
A: Oh really? I’m thinking to limit my kids screen time. I’m worried they’re on their phones
and video games too much.
B: Well are they getting their homework done? I don’t pay attention because my kids always
finish their homework first.
A: Yeah they are finishing their homework.
B: Okay. Well ask long as my kids have their homework done, I don’t worry about screen
time.
A: Don’t you think it’s bad for them to be on their phone or computer all day?
B: Well… it might be bad for their eyes. But then again… reading indoors for too long is also
bad for your eyes. So I don’t really know where to draw the line.
A: But don’t you think they should be outside having fun? Like we did when we were kids?
B: Well, my kids do spend time outside when it’s nice out. And I don’t want to be a hypocrite.
I spent a lot of time playing Nintendo games and computer games as a kid.
A: I just don’t think it’s good for them though.
B: It’s your decision! But if you give them a rule about screen time then you have to follow it
too.

## Describe a device you own that is very important to you.
You should say:
* what it is
* when you got it
* how often you use it
* And explain how different your daily life would be without it.
```
It’s difficult to choose just one device that is the most important to me. But I guess I would have to
choose my smartphone. I got my most recent smartphone this February. I usually get a new smartphone
every 1 – 2 years. I try to stay up to date with the most recent technology.
I use my smartphone every day, several hours a day. My work is tied to my smartphone. I use my
phone to find new clients and keep in touch with current clients. I also love to take pictures and videos
with my smartphone.
My life would be drastically different without my smartphone. Maybe I would have to choose a
new career if I didn’t have my smartphone! I think my smartphone makes life easier in all aspects. For
example, I always use my smartphone for directions while driving. It’s so much easier than looking up
directions and try to memorize them when you go to a new place.
