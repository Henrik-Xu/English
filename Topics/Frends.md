## Homework:
Describe a childhood friend

You should say:
* Who they are
* If you are still friends
```
I would like to tell you about my very first friend. At least the very first friend that I can
remember. His name was Timmy and he was a boy my age who lived right across the street.
We went to the same school and our families got along very well. I think we became friends
at about 3 or 4 years old and I spent many afternoons over at his house and he spent many
afternoons at mine.
My parents often praised me for being a smart little girl because I was a bit above average
from my peers. Not a whole lot smarter than my peers, but I was a bit above average. I
remember when I would want to brag or show off to my friend Timmy, I would always
discover that he was 2 or 3 steps ahead of me already. I may have been a bit a bove average,
but Timmy was well above average intelligence for his age. So much so that he skipped the
first grade. I remember feeling jealous of him, but I also strived to be like him. To this day I
try to surround myself with friends who are more intell igent or more skillful than myself.
Eventually Timmy and I had a falling out. Our falling out was over cooties. Cooties are
fictional germs. Little girls will often say that boys have cooties and vice versa. I believe
Timmy accused me of having cooties and he no longer wanted to be my friend, he wanted to
hang out with the boys instead. Of course, it wasn’t a real falling out. We’re still friends and
keep in touch occasionally on Facebook. It’s fascinating to check in every now and then and
see what became of my first ever friend.
