Lately my favourite hobby is playing the ukulele. You don’t need a lot of equipment, just a ukulele, maybe a pick, and a tuner; but they can be pretty cheap.
I first became interested in learning after my sister started. I saw how fast she picked it up and I was eager to learn as well. She began playing about a year ago, but I didn’t really start until March this year.
At first, I found it a bit difficult to learn. My biggest challenge was strumming and singing. With my sisters help and lots of practice I soon got the hang of it. Now I can learn a new song in just a few minutes!
I have so much fun playing my ukulele. I’ve always loved to sing and loved playing musical instruments, so this is a lot of fun for me. I feel like it’s a kind of meditation. When I play the ukulele, I get extremely focused on playing the music as well as I can. It completely distracts me from any problems that might be bothering me that day.
