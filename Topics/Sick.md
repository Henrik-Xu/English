```
I was out shopping with a friend once when suddenly I began to feel very hot. I thoug ht,
maybe it’s just hot in here, so I asked my friend if she thought it was hot inside. She said she
didn’t feel hot at all, and she noticed that my face and neck were unusually red. We both
thought that maybe I had eaten something bad for lunch and perhaps I was getting a fever.
We headed home, I went to go lay down, but I was still feeling very hot and uncomfortable.
When I woke up the next day, I still felt hot, and I had developed a rash on my chest and
arms. I had no idea what caused this rash, so I decided to go to the hospital. At the hospital
they told me the rash was caused by an allergic reaction. But they didn’t help me find out
what I was allergic to. They gave me some antihistamine medication to help with the
itchiness and they sent me home.
Since I didn’t know what was causing the rash, I couldn’t do anything to avoid it. And by
the next day the rash wasn’t just on my chest and arms, the rash was all over my entire
body. From head to foot, I was covered in a red, itchy rash. So, I went back to the hospital.
They gave me a stronger antihistamine medication through an IV drip. I was to take this
medication for the next three days. By day two there had been no improvement, and I still
didn’t know what had caused the rash.
I was on the phone with my mom when it finally clicked, my mom told me that as a little
girl she had very sensitive skin and she had a few allergic reactions to scented skin
products. And I figured out what had caused the rash. I had recently started using a new
scented laundry detergent and I had continued wearing my clothes that were washed with it
because I didn’t realize that’s what had caused the rash.
I washed all my clothes with baby laundry detergent, and my rash cleared up over the
next couple days. Since then, I have never used scented laundry detergent or scented body
wash and I have never had another bad rash like that.
