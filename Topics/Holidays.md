## Dialog – planning a Christmas party
```
A: It’s December!
B: Yes, it is.
A: So are we going to have an office Christmas party sometime this month?
B: We didn’t have one last year, so probably not.
A: No way! We have to have a Christmas party. I can organize it!
B: Okay. I’m sure management would be fine with that. What do you want to do for the
Christmas party?
A: Well, I think we should do a gift exchange. They’re so much fun. And we can listen to
Christmas music and eat Gingerbread cookies.
B: Wow, sounds fantastic. How will we do the gift exchange? Like a Secret Santa gift
exchange?
A: Well, I never liked Secret Santa gift exchanges. They’re difficult to prepare, and it sucks
when you have to get a gift for someone you don’t know well. No, I was thinking to do a Yankee
Swap instead.
B: Yankee Swap? What’s that?
A: It’s an American style gift exchange. It’s super fun. So, everyone comes to the party with a
gift. The gift should be suitable for anyone, and you can’t label it. All the gifts go into a pile.
When we start the gift exchange each person picks a number. Number 1 goes first, and they get
to pick any present. After they open their present number 2 gets to go. Number 2 can choose to
steal the present from number 1 or take a new present from the pile.
B: Oh that sounds fun! So, it’s best to go last?
A: Oh definitely! When you go last you can steal any present you want or open the last present.
B: We should definitely do that! Go ask management today!
A: I will!

## Homework:
Describe holiday traditions that your family has.

You should say:
* what the holiday is
* what the tradition is
```
I’d like to tell you about how my family celebrates Christmas. Every western
family has their own Christmas traditions. In my family we like to have a turkey
dinner on Christmas Eve, and open one present on Christmas eve. On
Christmas morning we open the rest of the presents, and my mom makes a
breakfast called “Wife-saver”. It is a type of casserole that is prepared the
night before, and then popped into the oven in the morning. It has layers of
bread, egg, ham, cheese and topped with cornflakes.
On Christmas Eve or Christmas day we always watch the same movie. It’s
called “National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation”. It’s a Christmas comedy
movie. It is absolutely hilarious, and I strongly recommend it.
As a Christmas gift, my mom usually gives us the same things every year. A
set of pajamas, pairs of socks, and a box of chocolate.
