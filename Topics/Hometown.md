My hometown is a small town in Manitoba. It’s called Brandon and it’s known for
wheat farming. Brandon is on the Canadian prairies. It has long cold winters but als o
hot humid summers.
I enjoyed growing up in Brandon because it’s such a small, quiet town. The crime rate
is low, and the public facilities are all pretty good.
The only problems that face Brandon are natural ones. Brandon gets a lot of
blizzards in the winter with freezing temperatures as low as -40 degrees. Then in the
spring Brandon gets flooded every couple of years. In the summer Brandon also has
a terrible mosquito problem, because the summers are very humid and there are lots
of small ponds for the mosquitos to have babies in.
Aside from those problems in my hometown, I still this it’s a good place to live as a
child and as an old person. When I start a family or when I’m old maybe I’ll move
back there, but right now it’s not really exciting enough for me.
