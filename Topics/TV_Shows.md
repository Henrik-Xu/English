## Dialog
```
A: I want to start watching a new show, can you give me a recommendation?
B: Sure, what kind of show do you want? A sitcom? Drama?
A: Anything, what’s your favourite show?
B: I have lots of favourites. How about Breaking Bad? Have you seen it?
A: No, I never did watch that one. I heard it was kinda boring though.
B: Well, some episodes have bad pacing yeah. Haha like in one episode we just watch them eat
breakfast. So, I guess it is a little boring sometimes. But I love it.
A: Okay, well what do you like about it?
B: The storylines are great. And the characters are very realistic.
A: Realistic? How so?
B: You know how some TV shows all the characters are Hollywood gorgeous, and super fashionable?
Well, that’s not Breaking Bad. In Breaking Bad the actors are all very average looking.
A: But what about Jesse Pinkman? Don’t you think that actor is quite handsome?
B: Yeah, but he’s believable handsome! Also, the way he dresses and talks is spot on. I knew many guys
in High School who talked and dressed just like him.
A: Alright, I’ll have to check it out then.
B: Yeah, you definitely should.

## Teachers Example:
```
I’m going to talk about the TV show “How I met your mother”. This TV show is about a
group of friends and how the main character Ted, met his wife who he ends up having
children with.
The main characters are Ted, Barney, Robin, Marshall, and Lily. I really liked all the
characters and they remind me of my group of friends. Each episode the group is
dealing with a new problem that is common for people in their 20’s and 30’s. Usually
they are dealing with dating problems, for example How do you break up with someone
nicely? Is it a good idea to date a co-worker?
I liked this show a lot because it was very relatable to me. I often found myself in similar
situations as the characters on the show. However, I really didn’t like the series finale.
Let’s just say… It felt like an unrealistic ending for these characters. And I wasn’t the
only one to dislike the ending, a lot of my friends also hated the ending. It was such a
pity. But oh well, you can’t win them all.
