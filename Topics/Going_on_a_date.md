Let me tell you about the most awkward date I have ever been on. This date
was so awkward because I didn’t realize it was a date… until it was too late.
Let me tell you how this date came to be.
I was at a music festival one weekend with some friends, but during the music
festival it started pouring rain. We were all soaking wet and decided to leave
the festival early. My friends invited me to their friend Jake’s house. I had
never met Jake before, and I said I didn’t want to go because my clothes were
soaking wet. But my friends told me Jake could lend me some dry clothes, and
I decided to go.
We all hung out at Jake’s house for a while, and he lent me some dry clothes.
When it was time to leave, I got Jake’s number and I told him I would meet up
with him later that week to bring his clothes back. This is where things get
awkward… I met up with him that Thursday just to bring him his clothes. We
had agreed to meet up in the city, go get a beer and hang out for a bit.
In my mind, this was not a date. I was just returning his clothes. But when I
met up with him, I noticed he was acting very strangely. We went out for a beer
and then he started asking me about my ex-boyfriends… That’s when I realized
that he thought it was a date. Unfortunately, I was just not interested in him
and I didn’t know what to say. He asked me out again and I did end up telling
him that I wasn’t interested and that I wasn’t aware we were going on a date.
When you ask someone out, it’s a good idea to make it clear that you want it to
date.
