Let me tell you about my old job at an English School in Beijing. I used to work
at Best Learning English as an English Teacher of course. I was teaching kids
between the ages of 4-10. I really enjoyed teaching there, but I did not so
much enjoy the company.
Everyday I would teach about 4 hours of class, and I would have about 4 hours
of office time to prepare my lessons. For each class I would have a Chinese
teaching assistant. Some of my assistants were amazing and we became close
friends.
My favourite part of that job was definitely my students and my co-workers. My
least favourite part was dealing with the company. It felt like they were always
trying to find new ways to reduce our pay. Or they would give me too many
students, or put students in the wrong class.
