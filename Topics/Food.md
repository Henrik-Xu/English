Let me tell you about my favourite restaurant in Beijing. It’s called ManFuLou. It’s a hotpot restaurant in old Beijing. I used to go there all the time when I lived in Beijing.
I loved going to that restaurant because it’s decorated very well in a traditional Chinese style. The pots for the hotpot are very nice, and even the outside of the restaurant is well decorated.
I liked going there because of the good decoration, the good food, and the good prices. I thought it was a great restaurant to bring foreigners who were visiting Beijing because it was decorated in an authentic Chinese style.
