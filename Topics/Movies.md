Teacher’s Example Answer:
```
OK, I'm going to describe a movie I recently enjoyed. It's called Parasite. It's a drama, comedy. 
I saw it a couple of months ago at our local theater.It is a Korean film, made by a well-known 
Korean director. The movie is about a down on their luck Korean family. The family members are 
all talented and intelligent but unable to find work. It’s a great representation of the struggles 
of lower-class people.I really enjoyed it for a few reasons. Firstly, because the characters are so 
interesting, and you want them to succeed. Secondly, the directing is amazing. He added so many details, 
and the film looks beautiful. Finally, I really liked that it was set in Korea. It gave me as an outsider, 
a look into the lives and struggles of Koreans. Of course, this movie is an exaggerated example of life 
in Korea.
