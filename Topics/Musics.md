## Describe a song or music album you like.
You should say:
* what type of music it is
* when you first heard it
* how often you listen to it
* And explain why you enjoy listening to it.
## Example:
Let me tell you about my favourite album. My favourite album is “A Night at the Opera” by Queen. This album was made in the 70’s and it’s a classic rock album.
I first heard this album in High School shortly after I discovered who Queen was. I fell in love with it instantly. I just love classic rock. And this album is so... artistic. It really does have this feeling of going to the opera but in a cool rock and roll kind of way.
I used to listen to this album on repeat. So much so that my mom once asked me to “Please just listen to anything else! Enough Queen!” I still listen to it regularly. It’s a great album to listen to on long car trips.
The songs on this album are expert level, classic rock. Each song beautifully transitions into the next song. And each band member is so talented. Freddie has an amazing voice and the lyrics of the songs are spectacular. Brian May is an amazing guitarist. His guitar solos will just blow you away. Roger the drummer is an excellent drummer of course, but he’s also an amazing singer. He can hit all the high notes.
They really are such an amazingly talented band. Their music almost feels like classical music... but in rock and roll form.
