```
One time while I was in university, I realized that I had gained a lot of weight.
At first, I didn’t notice, but when my old clothes didn’t fit, I realized that I had
gained about 15 pounds. Then I decided that I wanted to get back in shape.
First, I needed to change my diet. At the time I was often drinking soda and
eating chocolate. I was also eating a lot of friend noodles for lunch that had
little nutrition. So, I stopped drinking soda, eating sweets, and I started eating
healthier meals. No more fried noodles.
Second, I started working out in the morning. I bought a small set of weights
and a yoga mat. Every morning as soon as I got out of bed, I would do a small
workout routine. I only worked out for about 20-40 minutes a day, but even with
that I started to notice a difference.
I can’t remember how long it took for me to get back to my original size but
eventually I did. I think my poor diet was the main reason that I gained weight
in the first place. So remember, if you want to stay in shape eat a healthy diet.
