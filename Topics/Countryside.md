Jessica: Hi Andrea, is that you?
Andrea: Hello? Oh Jessica?
Jessica: Yes! How are you? It’s been forever!
Andrea: Omg hi yes, it’s been ages!
Jessica: So, what brings you back home?
Andrea: Well, I’m just home to visit family. What are you doing back home?
Jessica: I still live here! I never left!
Andrea: Wow, really?
Jessica: Yeah, I love our little town. You know, my husband and I just bought a farm out by
highway 10.
Andrea: Oh, my goodness that’s amazing. Congratulations.
Jessica: Thank you. So how is city life treating you?
Andrea: It’s amazing. I love living in the city. It’s great to visit back home, but I’m so used to all
my big city, creature comforts. I don’t think I could live in a small town again!
Jessica: And I’m the opposite! I like going into the city for visits, but it’s just so loud and crazy. I
could never live in the big city.
Andrea: I can understand that, for sure. It was a bit of a culture shock when I first moved, but
it’s not for everyone!
Jessica: Yeah, different strokes for different folks.
Andrea: Well, I’ll see you around Jessica.
Jessica: Yeah, see you around.

* Where you live now, in the countryside or city?

I grew up in a small town and I always loved my small town. But for university I
decided to move to Beijing which is a mega city! Before living in Beijing, I
would have preferred to stay living in a small town. However, after getting used
to the hustle and bustle of the city I find myself often missing it.
In my ideal life, I would rather live in a city but visit the countryside often and
perhaps retire in the countryside. City life has many pros such as an exciting
night life, new restaurants to try, many places to shop, many activities to try,
beautiful parks, and the list goes on and on.
While the countryside doesn’t have these things, what the countryside does
have is peace and quiet. Sometimes the hustle and bustle of the city can
become too much, and we need a quiet break to recharge. I do think that too
much quiet time can quickly become boring for someone who has become used
to the exciting life of the city. That’s why I think the ideal lifestyle would include
both the countryside and the city.
