Let me tell you about the most formal dress that I have ever worn. It was my
graduation dress. In North America, high school kids have a big party when we
graduate high school. The girls all wear beautiful formal grad dresses and the
boys all wear suits.
I was so excited to pick out my grad dress. I wanted to find something formal
but with a lot of flare and personality. I think I found just the dress. It was a
strapless, yellow dress. The length was just past the knee. It had a big full skirt
with lots of tulle. A large bow around the waist and it was covered in black
polka dots. It was the prettiest dress I have ever worn.
To complete the outfit, I wore a nice pair of black strappy high heels and I wore
a large black flower in my hair. I also got my hair done in pretty curls at the
hair salon. I got MANY compliments that night. I just loved it. I can’t wait until I
go to another special occasion where I can wear such a pretty dress again!
