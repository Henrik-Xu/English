## Dialog – Upcoming test
```
A: I’m so nervous about my test on Monday.
B: Don’t be nervous! You’ve been studying all week. I’m sure you’ll do fine.
A: No, you don’t understand. This is actually the second time I’m taking the test.
B: The second time? What happened the first time?
A: I failed of course. I totally bombed.
B: You failed?? Oh no. How many points did you fail by?
A: A passing grade is 65%. I got 63%.
B: Well, you were so close! I’m sure with the extra prep you’ll do fine this time!
A: But what if I fail again?!?
B: Don’t think that way! Think positive thoughts. If you go into the exam with all that stress
and anxiety you won’t test as well.
A: Really?
B: Oh yeah. It’s scientifically proven. Also the night before the exam, don’t stay up all night
studying. You should get a good nights sleep.
A: But shouldn’t I spend the night before preparing?
B: No. You’ve already done all that you can to prepare. The night before you need to sleep
well so that your brain has lots of energy for the test!
A: Oh wow. I didn’t know that. Maybe that’s why I did so bad the first time. I was so tired
from studying all night.
B: Exactly. If you weren’t so tired the first time, maybe you could have gotten those two extra
points.
A: Okay. Thanks for the advice. I’ll go to sleep early on Sunday.
B: Good! I’m sure you’ll do great! Think positive!

Describe a difficult time that you experienced as a student.

You should say:
* when it was

* how you dealt with it
* And explain what you learned from this situation.
```
Let me tell you about my least favourite teacher that I’ve ever had. Taking their class
was definitely a challenging experience for me. This teacher worked at my University
in Beijing. He was an older man, and had a very traditional teaching style. He also
had a lot of traditional opinions about the world that he share with us in class.
Not only did I have a strong dislike for his ideas I also really disliked his t eaching
methods. He strongly believed in the use of rote memorization. He always told us to
just memorize the textbook. Then your Chinese will be great. That’s how I learned
English, I just memorized the textbook. (btw he never once spoke English to us in
class, probably because his English was terrible).
Now Westerners generally dislike the method of rote memorization. I had always
heard in school that wrote memorization is a bad way of learning. And that opinion
really stuck with me. So I refused his teaching methods and his testing methods
which strongly relied on memorization. As a result of this, I failed his class. It was the
first class I failed in University. At the time I was happy to fail his class because of
how strongly I disagreed with everything about him. But later on I realized that even
though I disliked him so much, maybe I should have just sucked it up and completed
his class properly.
