## Dialog – Talking about family relationships
```
A: Hey, how is your mother doing?
B: She’s doing much better, thank you for asking. We’re getting along a lot better now too.
A: That’s good to hear! I remember you saying that you guys used to fight a lot.
B: Oh yeah. She’s very controlling. But she has been much more easy going lately.
A: That’s great, sounds like you guys are finally seeing eye to eye.
B: Yeah, we’re doing much better. Definitely better than when I was young. My mom was so
controlling and demanding of me when I was younger. How are your folks?
A: They’re doing great. They’ve always been very laid back but supportive. I can’t imagine
having controlling parents. My parents were just always so chill but supportive.
B: You’re so lucky. But I do appreciate my parents pushing me to succeed. If they had n’t
pushed me so much I might not have turned out as successful as I am today.
A: Yes, that’s very true. It was nice having chill parents, but my brother had a difficult time in
school and my parents didn’t give him that much support with his schoolwork.
B: Oh wow, my parents had high expectations for my grades, but they always helped me
study. Without their support I definitely wouldn’t have had as much success in school.
A: Yeah, I think there isn’t one correct parenting style. Each style h as pros and cons.
B: Yes, I definitely agree.

Let me tell you about a family reunion my family had back in the summer of 2010. We have
had a few family reunions since then, but that reunion was the biggest.
It was a reunion for my mother’s side of the family. My Grandma, her sister and all their
children and grandchildren and even a few great grandchildren came. I got to see all my
Aunties, Uncles, cousins, and my cousin’s children. Plus, all my mother’s Aunties, Uncles,
and cousins.
We booked out a summer resort near our hometown. We did all kinds o f things like
swimming, barbequing, any kind of outdoor activity. It was a great time. I hope we can
arrange another family reunion like that soon!
