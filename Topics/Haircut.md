## Dialog
```
A: Hi there, so what are we doing today?
B: Hi, okay so for the colour I want some more highlights through the ends of the hair.
A: Okay, so a bit of an ombre effect?
B: Exactly.
A: And what kind of cut did you want today. Are we changing it up a lot or just a trim?
B: I want to take off about 2 inches of length. And then I want a bit of layering so that it’s not
all one length.
A: Okay for sure. And how about your bangs?
B: Well I’m trying to grow them out, so let’s just leave them alone for now.
A: For sure, no problem. And I recommend using a toner for the highlights.
B: Okay, what does the toner do? And how much does it cost?
A: The toner will make your blonde highlights less yellow and more of a natural blonde
colour. It costs $60.
B: Alright. That sounds fine to me.
A: Okay, I’ll go mix up the dye.
…
A: Alright so now I just have to dry your hair. How do you want it styled today?
B: I usually wear it straight, so let’s just straighten it.
A: Okay and can you show me where you want to part your hair?
B: Here.
A: Okay, no problem.

## Homework:
Describe your favourite type of hairstyle.

You should say:

* Why you like it
* Where you get it styled
* How long you’ve had this style
```
I like to try many different hairstyles. I used to change my hair almost once a month! Now, I
have two favourite hairstyles and I like to change between them every year or so.
My first favourite hairstyle is long with blonde highlights. I like this style because it’s very
easy. I can let my hair dry into wavy curls, or I can blow dry and straighten it. It’s a very easy
hairstyle that doesn’t require a lot of effort. There is a big problem with this hairstyle though.
When my hair is long, it’s also very thick. Every time I’ve had this hairstyle, it always ends up
driving me crazy because I have too much hair. My hair gets stuck in my jacket zipper, it gets
stuck under my purse strap, and gets too hot at the back of my neck.
Every time I’ve had my hair really long like that, I end up cutting it to chin length after a few
months. I love having chin to shoulder length hair! It’s feels so nice after having long hair. In
summer and in winter I don’t have to worry about my hair getting tangled in my clothes. Plus ,
my hair is always super healthy after cutting it short. I will usually keep my hair short for a
year or so before I start to grow it out again.
When I have short hair, I eventually start to miss having long hair, and when I have long hair,
I eventually miss having short hair. It’s a never-ending hair cycle.
