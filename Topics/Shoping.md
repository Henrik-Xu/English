## Homework:
Describe your favourite place to go shopping.

You should say:
* where the place is
* why you like it
* what wonderful things have you found there
```
I would like to tell you about the Beijing Zoo Market which was my favourite place to go shopping in Beijing while I was in university. The market was located across from the Beijing Zoo, hence the name Zoo Market. The name was extremely fitting though, as the inside of the market was also a total zoo.
I later discovered that you could find brand name clothing at this market like Billabong, H&M, and Zara. But it would be the clothes that did not pass quality control inspection. So, you can buy these clothes for a extremely discounted price. My University Student Budget liked this market a lot. I used to go about twice a month and only spend around 500 RMB. But for that 500RMB I could get so many pretty clothes. The quality was not the greatest though.
There was no need to bargain and haggle at this market because everything was priced very cheap. Unfortunately, this market was closed in the winter of 2017 or 2018.
