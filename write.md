## Keep your sentences short
Most experts would aggree that clear writing should have an average sentence length of 15 to 20 words.

## Prefer active verbs
Purpose: Do you want your letters to sound active and passive-crisp and professional or stufy and bureaucratic?

There are three main parts to almost every sentence:
* A subject(the person, group or thing doing the action)
* A verb(the action itself); and
* an object(the person, group or thing that are action is done to)
```example
Peter(subject) watched(verb) the televison(object)
```

Passive verbs cause several problems:
1. They can be confusing
2. They often make writing more long-winded
3. The make writing less lively.

Good uses of passives: they are times of course when it might be appropriate to use passive.
1. To make someting less hostile - 'this billl has not been paid'(passive) is softer than 'you have not paid this bill'(active).
2. To avoid taking the blame - 'a mistake was made'(passive) rather than 'we make a mistake'(active)
3. When you don't know who or what the doer is - 'The England team has been picked'.
4. If it simply sounds better.
Be aim to make about 80 to 90% of your verbs active.

## Use word that are appropriate for the reader.
When you are talking to your reader, say exactly what you mean, using simplest words that fit. this does not necessarily mean only using

simple words - just words that the reader will understand.

## Don't be afraid to give instructions
1. Sit!
2. Brush your teeth.
3. Please send it to me.

There are all commands - officially called imperatives. they are fastest and most direct way of giving some instructions.

If yor worry that commands sounds too harsh. But you can often solve this by putting the word 'please' in front.

## Avoid nominalisations
1. Nominalisations they merely the names of the things, they sound as if nothing is actually happening in the sentence.
2. Like passive verbs, too many of them make writing very dull and heavy-going.

```example
We had a discussion about the matter.
-> we discussed the matter.

The implementation of the method has been done by a team.
-> A team has implemented the method.
```

## Use lists where appropriate
List are excellent for spliting informaiont up.
1. If each point is a complete sentence, each point should start with a capital letter and with a full stop.
2. If a list that is part of continuous sentence, put semicolons(;) after each points and start each with a lower-case letter.

## Summary
1. Stop and think before you start writing. Make a note of the points you want make in a logical order.
2. Prefer short word. Long words will not impress your customer or help your writing style.
3. Use everyday english whenever possible. Avoid jargon and legalistic words, and always explain any technical terms you have to use.
4. Keep your sentence length down to an average of 15 to 20 words. Try to stick to one main idea in a sentence.
5. Use active verbs as much as possible. Say 'We will do it' rather than 'It will be done by us'.
6. Be concise.
7. Imagine you are talking to your reader. Write sincerely, personally, in a style that is suitable and with the right tone of voice.
8. And always check that your writing is clear, helpful, human and polite.
